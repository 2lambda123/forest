-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            A declarative language for specifying filestores.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:  A filestore is a structured collection of data files housed in a
              conventional hierarchical file system.  Forest is a domain-specific
              language for describing filestores. The language uses a
	      type-based metaphor to specify the expected structure,
	      attributes, and invariants of filestores.  Forest
              generates loading and storing functions that make it easy to
              connect data on disk to an isomorphic representation in
	      memory that can be manipulated as if it were any other
	      data structure.  Forest also generates metadata that
	      describes the degree to which the structures on the disk
	      conform to the specification, making error detection
	      easy. In a nutshell, Forest extends the rigorous
	      discipline of typed programming languages to the untyped  
              world of file systems.
