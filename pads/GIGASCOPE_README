Suppose <GTOP> is the top-level Gigascope directory,
and <GTOP>/src/pads is where pads gets checked out.

(1) building PADS

First, you need to define GIGASCOPE_HOME, as in
   > setenv GIGASCOPE_HOME <GTOP>           (csh/tcsh)
or 
   > export GIGASCOPE_HOME=<GTOP>           (sh/bash) 

(or I think you can pass GIGASCOPE_HOME=<GTOP> as a make arg)

From directory $GIGASCOPE_HOME/src/pads, if you do
   gmake install

it should install everything necessary,
in $GIGASCOPE_HOME/bin, $GIGASCOPE_HOME/lib, and $GIGASCOPE_HOME/include

(2) building in a demo dir
