January 24, 2005 - Mary

  o Changed rules.mk to fix incorrect definitions of cc/ld variables
    in rules.arch.darwin.ppc.mk. 

January 5, 2005 - Mary
  o Added XML "regression" test_xml target to pads/GNUmakefile

January 4, 2005 - Mary

  o Integrated PADS-Galax glue code into PADS code base.

    - Added pads/padsc/pads-glx source directory

    - Added pads/documents/{pads-glx-doc,pads-glx-talk} directories

    - Added new required environment variable GALAX_SRC to mk/rules.mk.
      Must point to galax source directory.

    - Added pads_glx target to pads/GNUmakefile : 
      Target is made when USE_GALAX=1

October 19, 2004 - Mary

  o Normalized occurrence of <pd> type for all P-types:
    <pd> is now _last_ child element 
    <pd> is only present if pd->nerr > 0
    Required changes to kth-child and path-walk functions in:
      padsc/comp/ckit/src/ast/extensions/pads/cnv-ext.sml
      padsc/comp/ckit/src/ast/extensions/pads/gen-galax-sig.sml
      padsc/comp/ckit/src/ast/extensions/pads/gen-galax.sml
      padsc/include/pglx-codegen-macros.h
      padsc/libpglx/path_walk.c
      padsc/libpglx/pglx.c

  o Updated regression tests

October 16, 2004 - Kathleen

A set of changes to support PADS+Gigascope

  o A couple of new include files
       A pads_gigascope.h
       A pads_gigascope_macros.h

  o GNUmakefiles and rules.mk: if GIGASCOPE_HOME is defined, then
    this becomes PADS_INSTALLROOT, and a -DFOR_GIGASCOPE flag
    is added to the compile options.  Also, FORCE_STATIC is set.
    GIGASCOPE_INCLUDES is set to the above include files.
    INSTALL_LIBDIR and INSTALL_INCDIR are now the target dirs for a
    'make install'.   install in libpads now also installs the ast
    library/libraries in INSTALL_LIBDIR (which does nothing if this
    is the same as the normal ast-ast/arch/<ARCH>/ 
       M rules.mk
       M GNUmakefile
       M padsc/GNUmakefile
       M padsc/include/GNUmakefile
       M padsc/libpads/GNUmakefile
       M padsc/libpglx/GNUmakefile

  o release.pl produces a tar file with a 'released' version of PADS.
    Currently its target use is Gigascope, so it replaces the checked in
    ast-zip/INIT packages with ast-ast/INIT packages to avoid
    building the compression libraries.  release.pl deletes files that
    should not be in the release, such as stuff that should remain internal
    to AT&T.  I may have missed some things.  It also replaces
    examples/tests/GNUmakefile with examples/tests/GNUmakefile.release.
    N.B. This means if you add a regression test that you think should
    be part of the release, you need to add it the corresponding rules
    to both GNUmakefile and GNUmakefile.release, AND you need to add
    the .c file to examples/tests/RELEASE_TESTS, which release.pl uses
    to figure out what data/test/regression files to keep.
     
       M scripts/release.pl
       R scripts/release/INIT.2003-10-31.tgz
       A scripts/release/INIT.2004-10-11.tgz
       R scripts/release/ast-ast.2003-10-31.tgz
       A scripts/release/ast-ast.2004-10-11.tgz

October 14, 2004 - Mary
  o Eliminated smart-node init call in pglx-codegen-macros.h that I
    don't understand that that trashes <pd> values. 

October 14, 2004 - Mary
  o Added clean regression results in examples/xml/regress

October 14, 2004 - Mary
  o Fixed XML representations of Parrays so that <pd> and <length>
    always follow <elt> elements. 

    - Required changes to several macros and generated code related to
      kth_childNamed and kth_child.

October 14, 2004 - Mary
  Dibbler example
  o Removed examples/p/{dibbler2.p,dibbler_manifest.p,dibbler_most_permissive.p}
  o Added examples/xml/tests/test_*_dibbler_notrailer
  o Added examples/data/dibbler.1 containing one record

  o Fixed bug in pglx_*.h templates : COPY_STRING must be defined in
    all template header files 

October 13, 2004 - Mary
  o Added examples/xml/README

October 12, 2004 - Mary
  PADS/Galax Interface:

  o scripts/INT_DO_SETENV.sh
    - Added arguments to package.cvs script, which did not work on
      Fedora

  o libpglx/ and include/templates/pglx*.h
    - Aligned with development version of Galax 

  o Regorganized padsc/examples/xml directory and installed regression
    tests.

    examples/xml:
	gen/	    Generated *.{h,c,xsd} files
	queries/    Example queries
	README	    
	regress/    Expected results for XML regression tests
	schema/	    PADS-specific XML schemas
	tests/	    Template *.[ch] files for testing 
	xml/	    Generated XML output

    Following directories are empty/unused but stuck in CVS:
        childrentest/
        data/  
	idltest/

19 October 2004 - Mary
  o Added pads-glx/doc directory

14 October 2004 - Mary
  o Pads_dm
    - Changed padsDocumentNode so that it always contains exactly one
      root element named <Psource>.

22 June 2004 - Yitzhak

  o In root directory:
      I've moved the files smart.c and smart.h to a new directory called smart.
      I've removed them from the root directory.
      I've also added a number of other new files to "smart". I will use smart 
      as my working directory until I'm ready to try integrating the changes 
      into the main pads src tree.

  o In api:
      I've modified the c api to support garbage collection of unreachable 
      nodereps.

  o In smart:
      Work-in-progress, as described above.

15 June 2004 - Yitzhak
  o Fixed new kth_child-based pads_dm implementation.
  o Modified the idl to treat result from kth_child as a nodeRep option. 
    Also added a type nodeRepOption, which will be treated differently by the 
    idl compiler than nodeRep.
    (Note: We use options becuase nodeRep is opaque and can't be tested for nullity.)
  o Added nodeRepOpt conversion functions to pads_dm_stub.c. These functions convert c nodeRep
    to ml "nodeRep option" and vice versa.
  o Added a debug targe to Makefile (plus some minor fixes).

10 June 2004 - Yitzhak
  o Added kth_child function to pads_c.idl and pads_pglx.c
  o Changed pads_dm.ml to use kth_child function

  o Updated api/README to more accurately reflect directory contents.
  o Removed root() function from pads_c.idl.
  o Created root.idl to contain root() function.
  o Modified pads_dummy.c to implement PGLX_generic_XXX functions rather 
    than the pads_c.h functions. Now, pads_pglx.c can work with both pads_dummy.c 
    and real PADS implementations.
  o Modified test_pads_c.c to use root.h.
  o Fixed Makefile so that pads-galax library is compiled identically whether 
    for testing or not.


8 June 2004 - Yitzhak and Mary and Bob
  o PADS Example compilation
    Added dependency in Makefile

  o  Updated TODO with a couple API fixes.

  o  Added new file ON_DEMAND for notes on on-demand parsing
      (includes notes on the need for a new way to do Identity testing).

  Testing

  o TEST=0 variable links without pads_dummy.o.
  o TEST must be set to one of 0 or 1.

  Pads_dm module:

  o Ancestor, descendent, etc. axes are implemented naively. Code
    taken from galax_dm.


7 June 2004 - Yitzhak and Mary

  Pads_dm module:

  o Re-align PADS-GALAX interface with current Galax abstract Dm module
 
  Makefile

  o Removed all references to byte-code compilation.  libpadsglxopt.{a,so} are
    native code libraries

  Testing

  o TEST=1 variable links pads_dummy.o to test libpadsglxopt
    independently of Pads generated libraries

  o Tested linking using test_pads_c_opt.  Uses TEST=1 and pads_dummy.c,
    which constructs simple XML document that simulates PADS library

23 November 2003 - Mary

  o Alignment with Nov'03 WD of Galax
