  PADS/Galax Interface:

  o scripts/INT_DO_SETENV.sh
    - Added arguments to package.cvs script, which did not work on
      Fedora

  o libpglx/ and include/templates/pglx*.h
    - Aligned with development version of Galax 

  o Regorganized padsc/examples/xml directory and installed regression
    tests.

    examples/xml:
	gen/	    Generated *.{h,c,xsd} files
	queries/    Example queries
	README	    
	regress/    Expected results for XML regression tests
	schema/	    PADS-specific XML schemas
	tests/	    Template *.[ch] files for testing 
	xml/	    Generated XML output

    Following directories are empty/unused but stuck in CVS:
