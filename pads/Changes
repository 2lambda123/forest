A set of changes to support PADS+Gigascope

  o A couple of new include files
       A pads_gigascope.h
       A pads_gigascope_macros.h

  o GNUmakefiles and rules.mk: if GIGASCOPE_HOME is defined, then
    this becomes PADS_INSTALLROOT, and a -DFOR_GIGASCOPE flag
    is added to the compile options.  Also, FORCE_STATIC is set.
    GIGASCOPE_INCLUDES is set to the above include files.
    INSTALL_LIBDIR and INSTALL_INCDIR are now the target dirs for a
    'make install'.   install in libpads now also installs the ast
    library/libraries in INSTALL_LIBDIR (which does nothing if this
    is the same as the normal ast-ast/arch/<ARCH>/ 
       M rules.mk
       M GNUmakefile
       M padsc/GNUmakefile
       M padsc/include/GNUmakefile
       M padsc/libpads/GNUmakefile
       M padsc/libpglx/GNUmakefile

  o release.pl produces a tar file with a 'released' version of PADS.
    Currently its target use is Gigascope, so it replaces the checked in
    ast-zip/INIT packages with ast-ast/INIT packages to avoid
    building the compression libraries.  release.pl deletes files that
    should not be in the release, such as stuff that should remain internal
    to AT&T.  I may have missed some things.  It also replaces
    examples/tests/GNUmakefile with examples/tests/GNUmakefile.release.
    N.B. This means if you add a regression test that you think should
    be part of the release, you need to add it the corresponding rules
    to both GNUmakefile and GNUmakefile.release, AND you need to add
    the .c file to examples/tests/RELEASE_TESTS, which release.pl uses
    to figure out what data/test/regression files to keep.
     
       M scripts/release.pl
       R scripts/release/INIT.2003-10-31.tgz
       A scripts/release/INIT.2004-10-11.tgz
       R scripts/release/ast-ast.2003-10-31.tgz
       A scripts/release/ast-ast.2004-10-11.tgz

  o Eliminated smart-node init call in pglx-codegen-macros.h that I
    don't understand that that trashes <pd> values. 

October 14, 2004 - Mary
  o Added clean regression results in examples/xml/regress

October 14, 2004 - Mary
  o Fixed XML representations of Parrays so that <pd> and <length>
    always follow <elt> elements. 

    - Required changes to several macros and generated code related to
      kth_childNamed and kth_child.

October 14, 2004 - Mary
  o Removed examples/p/{dibbler2.p,dibbler_manifest.p,dibbler_most_permissive.p}
  o Added examples/xml/tests/test_*_dibbler_notrailer
  o Added examples/data/dibbler.1 containing one record

  o Fixed bug in pglx_*.h templates : COPY_STRING must be defined in
    all template header files 

October 13, 2004 - Mary
  o Added examples/xml/README

October 12, 2004 - Mary
  PADS/Galax Interface:

  o scripts/INT_DO_SETENV.sh
    - Added arguments to package.cvs script, which did not work on
      Fedora

  o libpglx/ and include/templates/pglx*.h
    - Aligned with development version of Galax 

  o Regorganized padsc/examples/xml directory and installed regression
    tests.

    examples/xml:
	gen/	    Generated *.{h,c,xsd} files
	queries/    Example queries
	README	    
	regress/    Expected results for XML regression tests
	schema/	    PADS-specific XML schemas
	tests/	    Template *.[ch] files for testing 
	xml/	    Generated XML output

    Following directories are empty/unused but stuck in CVS:
        childrentest/
        data/  
	idltest/
