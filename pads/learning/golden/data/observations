1. Floating point numbers are not detected (1967Transactions)

2. Special characters are treated as newlines (boot.txt)

3. Dates are not detected (boot.txt, ai.3000, yum.txt)

4. If array body is too complicated, chances are it's not an array; also if an array has too few elements,
it may not be an array especially when it doesn't have a separator (boot.txt, rpmpkgs.txt)

5. If a Ty has too complex structure and low coverage, can consider downgrading it to a simple string because
it could be just comments, human language, rather than a fixed format (boot.txt)

6. File paths and URLs are not detected (boot.txt)

7. The current system was able to correct identify rc.sysinit and fsck have the same semantics (a daemon name) by putting them into a union (boot.txt)

8. Failed to recognize multi-line records and file that contains different types of records (convert.log)

9. Hostname was not identified (ai.3000)

10. Timezone -0700 taken as integer (ai.3000)

11. Terminator appears in the body of the array itself (dibbler.1000)

12. Failed to detect the file permission format as a whole string (ls-l.txt)

13. Array not detected when the separator is also used uniformly as a separator for structs (quarterlypersonalincome)

14. Unable to distinguish table headers from the table body (quarterlypersonalincome) -> 
consider doing the following rewriting:
(a1 + b1), (a2 + b2), (a3 + b3) = (a1, a2, a3) + (b1, b2, b3) 
where a and b are header and body rows of a table

15. Cannot handle Parray with a non-struct body, e.g. base or refinedbase (will be fixed) (rpmpkgs.txt)
