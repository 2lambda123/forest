This directory contains a prototype system for inferring a desription
of newline-separated ASCII data.  

Requirements:
You must have sml/nj 110.59 or later.

To build:
> make

To invoke:
./learn --help
Prototype Learning System
learn  [-d <string>] [-maxdepth <int>] [-h <float>] [-s <float>] [-j <float>] [--help] file...
-d	        output directory               (default gen/)
-maxdepth	maximum depth for exploration  (default 5)
-h	        histogram comparison tolerance (percentage, default 0.01)
-s	        struct determination tolerance (percentage, default 0.01)
-j	        junk threshold                 (percentage, default 0.1)

Sample invocation:
./learn apache.txt -d output/apache -maxdepth 3 

The tool currently sends to standard out the following information:
* A count of the number of records in the input file
* A list of the frequency distributions of the tokens in the file,
  grouped into clusters, sorted by the cluster with the lowest
  "score".  The score is a heuristic designed to find the cluster with
  the strongest signal.  
* An output indicating which cluster the system chose and the coverage
  of that cluster. 
* A representation of the inferred top-level type of the data in outputdir/Ty.
  Contexts that have not yet been analyzed are marked TBD.  For each
  such marker TBD_i in the type representation, there is a file in
  outputdir/TBD_i containing the portion of the original input that
  falls into that context.
