testing
-------

to decide
---------
  * design and implement support for bit fields
     - C bitfields have platform dependent semantics
       (fill from left or from right)
     - want to be able to define special bit patterns,
        either individual bits or collections of them.
  * padsl pragmas for specifying record-type, endian, slurp mode
  * add struct predicates to calculuate properties of entire struct
	- consider adding an overlay ability here, which would
	  reinterpret something of buffer type
  * allow union arms with no variable names by specifying a tag name
  * more convenient ways of specying error-mask settings.
  * support for optional fields?
  * how to handle name conflicts for enums and unions
     how relates to name spaces and separate compilation
  * in-place parsing from buffers?

data formats to write
---------------------
  * netflow data
  * DNS data

to document
-----------
  * write documentation to allow users to define new base types.
  * write user manual

library todo
------------
 * add nerr to padsc base types
 * buffer data source

MORE BASE TYPES:
 * adate
 * echar, estring, estringFW, estringSE, estringCSE
 * afloat32, afloat64, bfloat32, bfloat64
 * BCD (numeric), rational numbers (fixed point, unsigned fixed point)
 * astringME, estringME (low priority)

IO STUFF:
 * PDCI_IO_commit_sfwrite : writes all bytes from start of checkpoint
                            to the current IO cursor that is being committed
                            to the sfio stream provided
           => requires support from io disciplines, a fun call that gives    
                start and end positions for an sfio write and also gives
                a new io_cur_elt/io_remain to allow cleanup after write

ACCUM STUFF:
  * accums should keep track of bad values, they are
      sometimes even more interesting than the good values
  * sort error codes into parser versus semantic errors
     include in accumulator bad values with error codes 
     that indicate semantic rather than parser level errors
  * Need function for reporting numbers of errors

DISCIPLINE:
 * let user set hash table size, include a symbolic constant for 
    keep everything.
 * accumulator controls:
    top N to print, threshold percentage to print,...

padsc compiler todo
-------------------
  * make enum.p work (strings that match c keywordsk, etc)
  * don't complain about extra spaces if in slurp mode
  * generated accum types should have some top-level state
     as well as per-field accums.  one idea is to accum the nerr
     field so that one could report the distribution of error
     cases, as in struct example:
            0 elt errors         88% of time
            1 elt errors         10% of time
            3 elt errors          2% of time
     More basic thing would just be number of good/bad values
     # Need a library function for reporting error distribution.
  * implement compiler optimizations mentioned in talk
      - glomming ignores (see examples/gen/dibbler2-mod.c)
        # I'm not sure this is a good idea.
        # I would want to see performance numbers to show it is an
	  optimization.
        # Static specification of error mask and related customization
	  will be a bigger win, I think.
  * fix accumulator generation program to start from file type
  * add analysis to determine if checkset mask is plausible 
    given other constraints
  * can we access the length of an array or the tag on a union
    after we have parsed the associated data?
  * empty structs
  * change comment character to //-
  * generate copy functions
  * generate write functions
        - original
        - xml (need canonical mapping)
