ints -> PDC_uint32


8/5/2003
  * generate better error message if field type is non-existent.
  * error if sep and term are the same char


8/4/2003
  * pd needs to be illegal for struct/union field names, enum labels
  * empty structs (create dummy field of type PDC_char)

8/1/2003
  * add struct predicates to calculuate properties of entire struct
	- consider adding an overlay ability here, which would
	  reinterpret something of buffer type

  * more convenient ways of specying error-mask settings.

 * accum for char
 * print routine for nerr accum

base types
     * adate
     * echar, estring, estringFW, estringSE, estringCSE [done?, no test?]
     * BCD (numeric), rational numbers (fixed point, unsigned fixed point)

IO STUFF
 * io discipline for IBM-style records, vlvd whatever 

ACCUM
  * generated accum types should have some top-level state
     as well as per-field accums.  one idea is to accum the nerr
     field so that one could report the distribution of error
     cases, as in struct example:
            0 elt errors         88% of time
            1 elt errors         10% of time
            3 elt errors          2% of time
     More basic thing would just be number of good/bad values
     # Need a library function for reporting error distribution.

compiler
  * generate write functions
        - original
