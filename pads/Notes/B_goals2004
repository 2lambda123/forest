Rick, I am leaving off P4P goals because I am not sure yet where that
project is going.  If that project goes away I will probably be looking
for another project to augment my PADS research.

         2004 GOALS/OBJECTIVES
         ROBERT GRUBER --- HB8680000

1. PADS
   a) Get PADS released.  This includes subgoals:
         + Get Andrew Hume using PADS
           (DGB asked for AT&T in-house use before release).
         + Finish writing the manual.
   b) Work with Trevor Jim on using PADS for automatically generating
        parsers based on IETF specs (http, DNS, etc.).
   c) Do extensive performance testing and tuning.
   d) Continue to work with Mary Fernandez on PADS/Galax (XQuery) integretation; 
      the next big step is to develop and use a Galax streaming model.
   e) Continue to evolve the language, code generator, and core library.

2. Professional development
   a) Submit papers based on PADS work.

3. Objectives
   a) Continue to support Ken Lyons use of CORBA to access ECIP3 LEC gateway services.
   b) New project: support Howard Katseff use of CORBA to access MSAG address validation services.
