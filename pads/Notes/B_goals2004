Rick, I am leaving off P4P goals because I am not sure yet where that
project is going.  If that project goes away I will probably be looking
for another project to augment my PADS research.

         2004 GOALS/OBJECTIVES

1. PADS
   a) Get PADS released.  This includes subgoals:

         + Finish writing the manual.
   b) Do extensive performance testing and tuning.
   c) Continue to work with Mary Fernandez on PADS/Galax (XQuery) integretation; 
      the next big step is to develop and use a Galax streaming model.
