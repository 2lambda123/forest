General organization of tests:
=============================
Example PADS Descriptions are in 

	examples/p/X.p

Corresponding data files are in 
	
	examples/data/X.extension

Drivers for loading/parsing data files are in:

 	examples/tests/test_X.c

Output of regression tests is in:

 	examples/regress/test_X.regress

Tests for PADS/Galax Interface
==============================

Tests for PADS/GALAX interface are in:

	pads/padsc/examples/xml

Drivers for PADS/Galax: 

    Loading
    =======
 	gen/test_load.h :

	  (Currently,) the loading driver tests the PADS/Galax data
          model interface by reading in a pads source, creating the
          pads XML node representing that source, calling the
          padsDocument constructor to create an instance of an XML
          document, then calling Galax to serialize/print the source
          in XML.
	  test_load.h is a template for creating other tests. See
	  test_load_myenum.c for an example usage.

    Getting the Kth Child
    =====================
 	gen/test_kth_child.h :

	A simple template for testing the XXX_kth_child function.

    Querying
    ========
 	gen/test_query.h :
 
	  (Currently,) the query driver takes as input the name of a
          pads data source (that must conform to the definition X.p)
          and the name of an XQuery file containing a query to apply
          to the source.  The driver reads in the pads data source,
          creating the pads XML node representing that source, calls
          the padsDocument constructor to create an instance of an XML
          document, then applies the query to the padsDocument node,
          and serializes the result to standard output.
	  test_query.h is a template for creating other tests. See
	  test_query_myenum.c for an example usage.

	queries/test_X_*.xq:

          Example queries that can be applied to data sources that
          conform to X.p.

    NB: There are NO checks in the drivers that a-priori determine
    that the input data source matches the pads description for which
    the driver is written.
