test_format1.c: pretty-prints with XML format data sources for the PADS file
		examples/p/format1.p
		It can be used with examples/data/format1
	    	Notice that format1.p was modified: 
		(1) the Precord modifier was erased from the "test" Pstruct 
		    and included in the "test2" Pstruct.
		(2) a separator literal ("=") was added to "test2" Pstruct.

test_struct3.c: pretty-prints with XML format data sources for the PADS file
		examples/p/struct3.p
		It can be used with examples/data/struct3.ok
		
test_ai.c: pretty-prints with XML format data sources for the PADS file
	   examples/p/ai.p
	   It can be used with examples/data/ex_data.ai and 
	   examples/data/ai.big

compile: a simple script that compiles test C programs.
	 Use: compile <name> 
	 where <name> is the name of the PADS file (without .p extension). 
	 It assumes that the test C program for "<name>.p" is called 
	 "test_<name>.c"
