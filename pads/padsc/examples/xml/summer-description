We (Mary Fernandez, Bob Gruber, and Kathleen Fisher) would like to
host a summer student to work on integrating XQuery with PADS.  In
particular, we would like to extend the PADS and XQuery
infrastructures to allow people to write XQuery queries against raw
data whose format has been described using PADS.  Such queries would
be compiled using Galax into a typed intermediate representation that
would invoke functions in a PADS-generated library to access the raw
data.  The summer student would work on defining the API between Galax
and PADS and translating the Galax typed intermediate representation
into C-code to link with the PADS library.

Ideally, the summer student would be a graduate student with
programming language expertise, as the work will involve a lot of
meta-programming.  We do not yet have a student in mind, but Greg
Morrisett, Benjamin Pierce, Craig Chambers, or Zhong Zhao might have
students with the appropriate skills and interests.
