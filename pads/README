=========================================
  Building, Intalling, and Testing
   the PADSC Compiler and Library
=========================================

Note: these instructions use GNU make (often called gmake or make).
Be sure that the make program you are using is GNU make before
proceeding.

STEP 1: ENVIRONMENT SETUP

Suppose you checked out the padsc module in /home/fred/padsc.  You
must arrange to have env variable PADS_HOME set to this location
before doing other steps.  Once PADS_HOME is set, you can source a
DO_SETENV script that will set the other env variables that you will
need.  DO_SETENV will also make your installation directories
(rooted at $INSTALLROOT) if they do not exist yet.

Below are instructions for different kinds of shells.
You could do the following by hand, or add them to your shell init script.
Note: Use DO_SETENV rather than Q_DO_SETENV when running from
the command line, to see how the env variables that are set up.

For csh/tcsh users:
  setenv PADS_HOME /home/fred/padsc
  source $PADS_HOME/scripts/Q_DO_SETENV.tcsh

For sh/ksh/bash users:
  export PADS_HOME=/home/fred/padsc
  . $PADS_HOME/scripts/Q_DO_SETENV.sh

Install link to SML runtime environment:
  Follow instructions in $(PADS_HOME)/binlinks/README

STEP 2: BUILD AND INSTALL THE PADSC LIBRARY

> cd $PADS_HOME/libpadsc
> gmake install

STEP 3: BUILD THE COMPILER

> cd $PADS_HOME
> gmake


STEP 4: TEST THE PADSC LIBRARY

> cd $PADS_HOME/libpadsc/tests
> gmake

This causes a set of regression tests for the library
to be built and run.  If you see a message of the form 

    test_foo DIFFERS

then there is a problem with the test_foo test.


STEP 5: TEST THE COMPILER

> cd $PADS_HOME/examples/tests
> gmake

This causes a set of regression tests for the compiler/library
to be built and run. If you see a message of the form 

    test_foo DIFFERS

then there is a problem with the test_foo test.
