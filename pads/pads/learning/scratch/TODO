useful to have verbose mode in pretty printing with coverage, if
coverage is one, emit line number

from railroad.txt:

record when two types are equal, only emit first definition; later
uses reference name.

in header identification, consider rewriting struct of unions to
union of structs to search for headers and footers.

from boot.log & yum.txt
 consider replacing complex structure with high score and low
coverage with "string"
 may have to be clever about finding a terminator
