1. 3 matrices for ocaml HMM library

1.1 InitProb
InitProb is a 1-dimentional matrix. InitProb[i] is the probability of
token i being the beginning of a line.

1.2 EndProb
EndProb is a 1-dimentional matrix. EndProb[i] is the probability of
token i being the end of a line.

1.3 EmitProb
TransProb is a 2-dimentional matrix. EmitProb[i][j] is the
probability of character feature vector i given token j: P(char_i|token_j)

Each bit in the character feature vector represents if this character
is a/an:
upper-case? 
lower-case? 
digit? 
punc? 
whitespace? 
"."? 
","? 
"?"?
"""? 

1.4 TransProb
TransProb is a 2-dimentional matrix. TransProb[i][j] is the probability
of token j given token i: P(token_j|token_i)

1.5 TokenName
a list of all tokens

2. These 3 matrices are computed based on the information in the
following 3 files:

2.1 TokenCount
format:
{token name}={number}
TokenCount is the number of occurrences of each token in terms
of characters.
example:
data: 13, token: int => int=2

2.2 CharTokenCount
format:
{character vector} {token name}={number}
CharTokenCount is the number of occurrences of one character matching a
specific character feature vector and one token. 
example:
data: 13, token: int => 001000000 int=2

2.3 TokenPairCount
format:
{token name} {token name}={number}
TokenPairCount is the number of occurrences of one token following
another token.
example:
data: march11:59, token: date time => 
date date=4
date time=1
time time=4
