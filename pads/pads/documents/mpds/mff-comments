1. 1st paragraph.  Not clear what "mined very profitably" means here. 
Could you give a few examples of the kinds
of applications(/information) that might mine(/be mined from) stream
data?

2. awkward sentence:
"Such conditions might require that two fields of a pstruct
are related via a particular function or that the elements
of a sequence are in increasing order."
Instead, how about:
"Such conditions might require that two fields of a pstruct
are related or that the elements
of a sequence are in increasing order.  Conditions may
be specified by a user-defined function or PADSL expression."

3. "web server" =>? "Web server"

4. In Section 3, might want to mention that records that
do contain errors can still be accessed by the application.
E.g., knowing how much of the data is erroneous and why
can be as important as processing the error-free data.
Also might want to mention what errors PADS cannot 
recover from.
