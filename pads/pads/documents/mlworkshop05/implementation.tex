\section{Implementation Techniques}
\label{sec:implementation-techniques}
To implement \padsml{}, we intend to leverage existing tools.  
We will compile our transform language into \sml{}.  The similiarity
between the two languages should make this translation relatively
straightforward.  We will use the existing \padsc{} system as an
implementation of the parsing library, sparing us the effort of
re-coding the parsers and ensuring that the parsing semantics of the
two systems are the same.  \padsc{} generates \C{} code, so we will
use existing interoperability tools for \sml{} to call the \C{}
parsers from the \ml{} version of our transforms.  The parser will
need to invoke \padsml{} predicates, which are written in our
transform language, so we will also need to use interoperability tools
to enable us to call from \C{} into \sml{}.
