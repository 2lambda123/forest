<a href="http://www.research.att.com/projects/pads"> PADS</a>:</em> Processing Arbitrary Data Streams</strong>
</p>


<p>
AT&T in general and research in particular generates and receives many
high-volume data streams with data that can be mined very profitably.
Unfortunately, many streams are in legacy formats over which we have
no control.  Understanding a new data feed and writing a suitable
parser are difficult tasks, both tedious and error-prone.
Often, the hard-won understanding of the data ends
up embedded in parsing code, making long-term maintenance difficult
for the original writer and sharing the knowledge with others 
nearly impossible.
</p>

<p>
The goal of the PADS project is to provide languages and tools for
simplifying data stream analysis.  We have a preliminary design of a
declarative data-description language, PADSL, expressive enough to
describe the data feeds we see in practice, including both ASCII,
binary, and mixed data.  From PADSL we generate a tunable C library with
functions for parsing, manipulating, and summarizing the data.  The
library is immediately useful for those who write C programs to
manipulate data streams.  Our next steps include using the library as
input to tools that query and aggregate data.  Our ultimate goal is
for data analysts to write just the declarative description of the
data and declarative queries -- no coding required.  Further, by
providing a means of describing all of Research's incoming data
streams using a common language, we open the possibility of
correlating and integrating the data from these streams.
</p>

<p>
We are very interested in learning about challenging
data formats, potential PADS users, data processing "knobs" that
have proven useful -- any and all input is welcome!
