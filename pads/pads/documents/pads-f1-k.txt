PADS: Processing Arbitrary Data Streams
---------------------------------------
Joint work with [Kathleen Fisher|Bob Gruber]

Databases are good at manipulating structured data, while XML and its
infrastructure can provide similar support for semi-structured data
encoded in XML.  However many data sources, typified by those in the
InfoLab, are in legacy formats over which data consumers have no
control. Currently researchers deal with such data in an \textit{ad
hoc} fashion, using Perl/shell scripts or hand-coded \C{} programs
that are hard to maintain, extend, and share.

The \pads{} project aims to make it easy to manipulate such data,
either programmatically or through high-level tools.  Central to
\pads{} is a declarative data-description language, \padsl{},
expressive enough to describe general data, including ASCII, binary,
and mixed data formats.  A \padsl{} compiler (\texttt{padsc}) then
generates a tunable \C{} library with functions for parsing,
manipulating, and summarizing the data.  Examples of data currently
handled are web log, Netflow, BGP, and Dibbler data.  In preliminary
testing without a number of planned optimizations, \pads{} programs
are roughly twice as fast as comparable Perl programs.

Longer term, we will use the generated libraries to construct
declarative interfaces to arbitrary data sources. In addition, we plan
to adapt tools designed for XML, such as Xquery, to work over legacy
data by making the legacy data ``look'' like XML.  Together with the
ability to generate \C{} interfaces, this approach allows application
developers to mix and match data representations as needed
to handle legacy system requirements while leveraging modern tools.

The project provides a common meeting ground for integrating the tools
and knowledge of many other researchers.  Some specific examples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  We are working with Andrew Hume to generate programs that
    characterize data files that have \cobol{} copybooks.  Hume is
    writing a copybook to \padsl{} translator.
  
    \item We are working with Glenn Fowler and David Korn to support
    command-line (\texttt{dss}) and scripting (\texttt{ksh}) interfaces to \padsl{} data. 

    \item  We are exploring with Mary Fernandez the use of XQuery to query
    \padsl{} data \textit{without} materializing that data as XML.

    \item  We are meeting with Ted Johnson (HB84) to explore incorporating his
    data summary and correlation work into our summarizers.

    \item We plan to work with David Poole to develop scripting tools so
    that data analysts can express queries and desired plots
    declaratively and get parsing, filtering, and aggregated input
    into S+ automatically, without any coding.
\end{itemize}

Finally, by providing a means to describe all of Research's incoming
data streams in a common language, we open the possibility of
correlating and integrating the data from these streams.

R.~Gruber presented \pads{} at the AT\&T/UCSD retreat in September.
I gave a cookie talk on 11/19 to get early feedback on the design of
\padsl{} and the generated library.
