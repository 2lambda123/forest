The explosive growth of the Internet has made monitoring and managing
data systems distributed across wide-area networks increasingly
important. The possibility of partial failure and the need to
synchronize makes such code tedious and difficult to write correctly.
%particularly for data experts whose skills are in domains other than
%networking. In this paper, we describe the \padsd{} system, which
The \padsd{} system allows users to declaratively specify their 
data systems and then generate a wide-variety of tools for 
manipulating the data: from
stand-alone tools, to simple libraries for writing their own analyses,
to generic libraries for building new generic tools.  We precisely
specify the meaning of our language via a sound denotational
semantics and show that this semantics is dependency correct. Finally,
we demonstrate experimentally that the system has
acceptable performance overheads.
