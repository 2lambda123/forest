Hancock
Hancock is a C-based domain-specific language designed to make it
easy to read, write, and maintain programs that manipulate gigabytes
of relatively uniform data in near real-time.   Currently, Hancock
programs are used to collect data that supports the Universe List and
Communities of Interest applications (Corinna Cortes, Daryl Pregibon,
and Chris Volinksy).  In addition, Scott Anderson from government
markets is using Hancock for a version of Communities of Interest over
IP addresses.  

Hancock uses Sfio, fixcut, rsort, and AUTOCONFIGURE.

Hancock has been released for non-commercial use outside of AT&T.  

Ongoing research topics for Hancock include better support for
variable-width data in logical streams and map values,  better
automatic compression functions, and increased key space.

PADS

PADS is a declarative data-description language for describing the
physical and semantic properties of data sources that arrive "as is."
From a PADS description, we generate a (robust, high-performance)
library for parsing, summarizing, and writing the associated data.
PADS supports a rich error-processing model.  Each parsing
function returns both an in-memory representation of the associated
data and an error descriptor.  Users can examine such error
descriptors to determine precisely the detected errors and take
application-specific responses: halt the processing program, discard
the buggy data, or repair it.

PADS uses SFIO and AST.

We are working with the Ningaui team to provide various tools to help
understand/manage some of their data.  Two such tools are:
1. Cobol copybook -> PADS translator -> accumulation program
   which allows statistical profiling of data sources with cobol
   copybooks without any programming.
2. Field selection program
   which supports automatic extraction of indicated fields from a data
   feed with a cobol copybook, again without any programming.

We have been talking with Trevor Jim about using PADS to describe
network packets for provably correct processing.

We are working with Mary Fernandez and Ricardo Medel to integrate PADS
with the Galax implementation of the XQuery query language.  This
integration will allow data analysts to write XQuery queries against
raw data sources with a PADS description.

There are many other open research problems in progress.
 
We are getting ready to release PADS for non-commercial use outside of
AT&T.
