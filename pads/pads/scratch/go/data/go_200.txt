comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to a class of gene products and a biological process rather than a molecular function. To update annotations\, consider the molecular function term 'unfolded protein binding ; GO\:0051082' and the biological process term 'ribosome biogenesis and assembly ; GO\:0042254' and its children.

The net result is the covalent interconversion of a disulfide and a dithiol." [UniProt:kd]
