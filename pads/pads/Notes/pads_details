[ARRAY]

1. Array copy assumes it can copy all but two pointer fields, which it
   assumes are always the _internal pointer and the elts pointer.

2. Arrays only grow, arrays containing dynamic elt type grow the number
   of allocated rbufs.  This avoid re-allocating rbufs on array re-use,
   but could also lead to problems.  We probably want an array 'truncate'
   function that sets the length of an array and also
   de-allocates any rbufs above that length.  Trunacte to its current
   length would then 'shrink' an array's memory use to the min needed.
