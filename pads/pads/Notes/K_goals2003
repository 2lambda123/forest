Business Goals:

Career:
  Develop abstractions and supporting tools to help people
  solve large-scale programming problems more quickly and more
  reliably.

  For example, the abstractions in the domain-specific
  language Hancock allow data analysts to develop
  signature programs more quickly and at two orders of
  magnitude larger scale than previously possible.

  My work on Moby allows programmers to use object-oriented
  abstractions in a language with a powerful module
  mechanism and highly scalable concurrency primitives.
  This combination will make it easier for programmers to
  write large, highly concurrent programs.

Annual:
1. PADS
   a) Add write functions (original, binary, XML) to generated libraries.
   b) Evolve language design, including adding support for switched unions.
   c) Work with other analysts to prototype some significant applications.
   d) Query tools:
      - Finish automatic generation of programs to compute
        accumulation statistics.
      - Develop C-based querying infrastructure.
      - Integrate with XQuery (with Mary Fernandez).
   e) Build tool to generate Hancock stream descriptions from PADS
      descriptions.
   f) Explore representation transformation issues.

2. Hancock
   a) Explore adding support for variable-width stream data.

3. Moby
   a) Write journal paper describing design of language.
   b) Write journal paper describing internal support for concurrency.
   c) Develop formal model of higher-order modules in a context
      with subtyping.  Implement these features in compiler.

4. Professional development
   a) Serve on ACM's SIGPLAN executive committee.
   b) Run the New Jersey Programming Languages Seminar.
   c) Chair FCRC's Educator's Travel Grant program.
   d) Attend the POPL conference.
