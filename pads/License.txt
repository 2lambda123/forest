You may also   make copies of the Software to the extent necessary to exercise the   rights granted to you by this Agreement.  All copies of the   Software shall retain the copyright notices appearing in the   Software.  You shall treat any Derivative Works that you may   receive from a Licensed User as Software under this Agreement. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, no rights or   licenses are granted under this Agreement, and no provision of this   Agreement shall be construed as conferring by implication, estoppel   or otherwise any license or right to you under any claim in any   patent of AT&T now or hereafter existing unless such claim is   completely embodied in the Software supplied with this Agreement   (in the case of an apparatus claim) or such claim is completely   performed by execution of the Software supplied with this Agreement   (in the case of a method claim) in either case, without the need   for any additional product, hardware, service, development,   modification, software or programming.  For the avoidance of doubt,   you shall have no right to reproduce, use or distribute the   Software, or prepare or distribute derivative works based upon the   Software for any purpose other than the purpose stated in Paragraph   1 of this Agreement.4. "Non-Commercial Purpose" means use of the Software and any   Derivative Works solely for education or research.  "Non-Commercial   Purpose" excludes, without limitation, any use of the Software or   any Derivative Works for, as part of, or in any way in connection   with a product (including software) or service that will be sold,   offered for sale, licensed, leased, loaned, rented or otherwise   made available commercially.  5. This Agreement is personal between AT&T and you.  You may not   accept this Agreement on behalf of any company, corporation or   other organization.  No ownership interest in the Software is   transferred to you.  AT&T may assign or transfer to any company or   person, or grant to any company or person a license or sublicense   under, all or any part of its interest in any rights to the   Software, this Agreement or any license or right granted to AT&T   pursuant to this Agreement.  You may not assign, transfer or   sublicense your rights without AT&T's written consent. 6. Under any patent rights and copyrights owned, licensable or   controlled by you which relate to the Software or any Derivative   Works you (i) grant to AT&T a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide,   fully paid-up, unrestricted, irrevocable license, along with the   right to sublicense others, to make, have made, use, offer to sell,   sell and import any products, services or any combination of   products or services, and (ii) release AT&T, its subsidiaries, its   affiliates and its customers from any act that was performed prior   to your grant of the foregoing license that would have been   licensed under such license had the license been in effect at the   time of such act.  This license and release shall survive any   termination of this Agreement. 7. AT&T may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending to the   e-mail address that you provided in order to gain access to the   Software, or by posting on the web site for the Software (the "Web   Site"), written notice of termination.  If the Web Site indicates   the duration of your rights (e.g., a 90 day evaluation), then this   Agreement shall automatically terminate at the end of the period   indicated.  Termination shall be effective as provided in the   notice.  Unless notice shall provide otherwise, upon termination   you shall destroy all copies of the Software and any Derivative   Works. 8. You acknowledge that the Software is subject to U.S. export laws   and regulations and any use or transfer of such Software must be   authorized under those regulations.

AT&T has no obligation to support or maintain the Software and   grants you this right to use the Software "AS IS".  YOU ASSUME   TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE. AT&T   DOES NOT MAKE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED   WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR ENDORSEMENTS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER,   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF   MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND THE   WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL AT&T BE   LIABLE FOR (i) ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES   (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,   BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR INFORMATION, AND THE   LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE,   EVEN IF AT&T OR ANY OF ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES HAS BEEN   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, (ii) ANY CLAIM   ATTRIBUTABLE TO ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR OTHER INACCURACIES IN THE   SOFTWARE, OR (iii) ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY.  YOU AGREE THAT   YOUR SOLE REMEDY AGAINST AT&T FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE RELATING TO   THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ANY DEFECT OR FAILURE IN THE SOFTWARE,   REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT,   INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE THE   REPLACEMENT OF THE SOFTWARE.  BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR   INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.   IN   SUCH STATES, AT&T'S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT   PERMITTED BY LAW.10. You shall indemnify and hold harmless AT&T, its affiliates and    authorized representatives against any claims, suits or    proceedings asserted or commenced by any third party and arising    out of, or relating to, your exercise of the rights granted to you    pursuant to this Agreement.  This obligation shall include    indemnifying against all damages, losses, costs and expenses    (including attorneys' fees) incurred by AT&T, its affiliates and    authorized representatives as a result of any such claims, suits    or proceedings, including any costs or expenses incurred in    defending against any such claims, suits, or proceedings. 11. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance    with the laws of the State of New York, USA, applicable to    agreements made and to be performed wholly in that State without    regard to its conflicts of law rules.  You agree that any legal    action or proceeding between AT&T and you for any purpose    concerning this Agreement, the Software, or any obligations    hereunder shall be brought exclusively in a federal or state court    of competent jurisdiction sitting in New York.  Any claim or cause    of action you may have with respect to this Agreement, the    Software or any obligations hereunder must be brought within one    (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises or such claim    or cause of action is barred.  AT&T's failure to insist upon or    enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement is    not a waiver of any provision or right.
