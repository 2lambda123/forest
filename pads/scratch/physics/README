I modified catalog.p:
  - introduced macro #define WS Pre "/ +/" to improve readability
  - I set #define WSPACE_OK in test program, so I could remove many of the WS .

This is one very small chunk of a catalog I am using that is derived
from publicly-available SDSS data.  The file format is as follows:

On top there is a line that says how many galaxies are described in
the file.  Below that, each line contains data for a single galaxy.
The columns (name and type) are:

1-3) position information: RA, dec, phi_offset (doubles)
4-10) identifying information: run, rerun, camcol, field, id, x, y (ints)
11-12) PHOTO flags1 and 2 (long hex)
13) flag3 (long hex)
14-23) extinction-corrected model magnitudes and errors in magnitudes (floats)
24-27) star, exp, and dev likelihoods (ints), size (float)
28-33) r-band shape measurement info directly from raw-bgCat (4 floats, 2 ints)
34-39) i-band shape measurement info directly from raw-bgCat (4 floats, 2 ints)
40-42) e1, e2, and sigma_e averaged over the two bands (floats)
43) r-band extinction (floats)
44) photoz from Blanton's program kphotoz, or -1 if the galaxy is too
faint for reliable photoz measurement (floats)
45) LRG photoz (floats)
