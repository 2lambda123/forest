<strong><em>PADS:</em> Processing Arbitrary Data Streams</strong>
</p>

<p>
AT&T in general and research in particular generates and receives many
high-volume data streams with data that can be mined very profitably.
Unfortunately, many streams are in legacy formats over which we have
no control.  An intense effort is required to understand a new data
feed and write a parser for the data, a process that is both tedious
and error-prone.  Often, this hard-won understanding of the data ends
up embedded in parsing code, making long-term maintenance difficult
for the original writer and sharing the knowledge with others still
more difficult.
</p>

<p>
The goal of the PADS project is to provide languages and tools for
simplifying data stream analysis.  We have a preliminary design of a
declarative data-description language, PADSL, expressive enough to
describe the data feeds we see in practice, including both ASCII,
binary, and mixed data.  From PADSL we generate a C library with
functions for parsing, manipulating, and summarizing the data.  The
library is immediately useful for those who write C programs to
manipulate data streams.  Our next steps include using the library as
input to tools that query and aggregate data.  The ultimate goal is
for data analysts to write just the declarative description of the
data and declarative queries -- no coding required.  Further, by
providing a means of describing all of Research's incoming data
streams using a common language, we open the possibility of
correlating and integrating the data from these streams; such
data integration is currently considered a nearly impossible task.
</p>

<p>
High-volume data stream processing is very tricky to "get right,"
and there is a great deal of knowledge and experience within Research
that we are attempting to leverage.  For example, such knowledge led
us to make the behavior of the generated code highly tunable,
including control of which elements from each record are actually
parsed, the level of constraint checking performed, whether errors
cause a single record to be skipped or the entire parsing process to
stop, etc.  We are very interested in learning about challenging
data formats, potential PADS users, data processing "knobs" that
have proven useful -- any and all input is welcome!
