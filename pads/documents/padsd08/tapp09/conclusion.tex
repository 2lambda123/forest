The explosive growth of the Internet has made monitoring and managing
data systems distributed across wide-area networks increasingly
important.  The possibility of partial failure and the need to
synchronize makes such code tedious and difficult to write correctly,
particularly for data experts whose skills are in domains other than
networking. In this paper, we describe \padsd{}, a specification
language for archiving distributed ad hoc data sources.  Our language
allows users to specify where, when and how their data sources are
to be acquired. From these specifications,
a wide-variety of tools to archive data and provenance metadata.  
Overall, we hope the system will substantially improve the productivity of
the modern data analyst.
