\section {Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

An {\em ad hoc data source} is any semistructured data source for
which useful data analysis and transformation tools are not readily
available.  The data that constitutes a single, abstract source 
often comes from many different concrete, physical destinations
distributed across the Internet.  It may also become available
over a range of times and in several, evolving formats.
Before the users can extract the information they need from the data,
it usually must be fetched, archived locally for historical analysis, 
compressed, encrypted, and monitored for errors or deviations from the norm.

There are all kinds of users of such data ranging from scientists to
system administrators to financial analysts.  To get more of a flavour
of one sort of distributed ad hoc data source, consider the data
manipulated by CoMon~\cite{comon}, a system designed to monitor the
health, performance and security of PlanetLab~\cite{planetlab}.  Every
five minutes, CoMon attempts to contact each of 842 PlanetLab nodes
across 416 sites worldwide.\footnote{Data as of writing this manuscript;
PlanetLab membership varies over time.}  
When all is running smoothly, which it
never, ever is, each node responds by sending back a data file
consisting of a number of valuable bits of information ranging from
the kernel version to the uptime to the memory usage to the id of the
user with the greatest CPU utilization.  CoMon archives this data in
compressed form and its backend processes the information for display
to PlanetLab users.  It is an invaluable resource for Planet users
who need to monitor the health and performance of their applications
or experiments.  Almost all distributed systems have (or should
have) similar sorts of monitoring infrastructure.  Unfortunately,
system implementers are often left
to hack ``one-off'' monitoring tools of their own, which are
invariably less reliable, unoptimized, insecure, and difficult or
impossible to evolve when new requirements become known.
A substantial part of the difficulty simply comes from the diversity, quality,
and volume of data these systems must often handle. Often, new
monitoring systems also face the problem of having to interact with legacy
devices, legacy software and legacy data, leaving implementers in a
situation where they cannot use robust off-the-shelf data management
tools built for standard formats like XML.

Somewhat similar problems also appear
across the natural and social sciences, including biology,
physics and economics.  For example, systems such as BioPixie~\cite{biopixie}, Grifn~\cite{grifn} and Golem~\cite{golem}, built by
computational biologists at Princeton,
routinely obtain data supplied from a number of sources scattered 
across the net.  The data is often archived and later analyzed or mined 
for valuable information about gene structure and regulation.  Likewise, 
cosmologists need access to data uploaded from major telescopes~\cite{sdss}
and economists can make use of vast data repositories at FedStats.org
amongst other sources.  These and other selected ad hoc data sources 
are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:exampledata}.
