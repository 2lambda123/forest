To introduce our feed declaration language, we work through a
series of examples of increasing sophistication, based around CoMon and
AT\&T's web hosting monitors. 

\subsection{CoMon Feeds}
\figref{fig:simplecomon} presents our first attempt to define
a simple CoMon statistics feed.  This description
specifies the \cd{simple\_comon} feed
using the \kw{base} feed constructor.  The \kw{sources} field
indicates that data for the feed comes from all of the locations
listed in \cd{sites}.  The \kw{schedule} field specifies that relevant
data is available from each source every five minutes, starting immediately.
When trying to fetch such data, the system may occasionally fail,
either because a remote machine is down or because of network
problems. To manage such errors, the schedule specifies that the
system should try to collect the data from each source for 60 seconds.
If the data does not arrive within that window, the system should give
up. Finally, the \kw{format} field indicates that the fetched data
conforms to the \padsml{}~\cite{mandelbaum+:pads-ml} description named
\cd{Source} defined in the file \cd{comon_format}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{code}
(* Simple CoMon distributed data description *)
\kw{let} sites = 
  [
    "http://pl1.csl.utoronto.ca:3121";
    "http://plab1-c703.uibk.ac.at:3121";
    "http://planet-lab1.cs.princeton.edu:3121"
  ] 
\kw{feed} simple_comon =
  \kw{base} \{|
    \kw{sources}  = \kw{all} sites;
    \kw{schedule} = every 5 min, starting now, 
               timeout 60.0 sec; 
    \kw{format}   = Comon_format.Source;  
  |\}
\end{code}
\vskip -2ex
\caption{Simple CoMon feed that fetches data from all sites every minute.}

\end{figure}

In contrast to the \cd{simple\_comon} feed, which returns data from
all sites, the \cd{comon\_1} feed defined in \figref{fig:comon_1}
uses the \kw{any} constructor in the \kw{sources} field to 
return only a single value per time slice: that of the first site to
supply a complete set of data.
%
\begin{figure}
\begin{code}
\kw{feed} comon_1 =
  \kw{base} \{|
    \kw{sources}  = \kw{any} sites;
    \kw{schedule} = every 1 min, lasting 2 hours;
    \kw{format}   = Comon_format.Source;
  |\}
\end{code}

This feature is particularly useful when monitoring the
behavior of replicated systems, such as those using
state machine replication, consensus protocols, or even
loosely-coupled ones such as Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs).
In these systems, the same data will be available from any
of the functioning nodes, so receiving results from the first
available node is sufficient. These kinds of monitoring systems
are useful in the face of partial network unreachability or
machine failure. Specifying this behavior at the language level
provides a simpler implementation than network-centric approaches such
as anycast \cite{anycast}. 

The schedule for \cd{comon\_1} indicates the system should fetch data
every minute for two hours, using the \cd{lasting} field to indicate
the duration of the feed.  It omits the \cd{starting} and
\cd{timeout} specifications, in which case the system uses default
%settings of \cd{now} for the start time and 30 seconds for the
%timeout.  
settings for the start time and timeout window.  

The \cd{simple\_comon} example hard-codes the set of locations from
which to gather performance data.  In reality, the CoMon system has an
internet-addressable configuration file that contains a list of hosts
to be queried, one per non-comment line. This list is periodically
updated to reflect the set of active nodes in PlanetLab. 

\figref{fig:feedcomon} specifies a version of the \cd{comon} feed that
depends upon this configuration information.  To do so, the
description includes an auxiliary feed \cd{nodes} that describes the
configuration information: it is available from the
\cd{config_location}, it should be fetched every two minutes, and its
format is described by the \padsml{} description \cd{source} given in
the file \cd{nodelist}, which appears in \figref{fig:nodepml}.
This \padsml{} description specifies that \cd{source} is a list of
new-line terminated records, each containing a \cd{nodeitem}.  In
turn, a \cd{nodeitem} is either a \cd{'#'} character followed by a
comment string, which should be tagged with the \cd{Comment}
constructor, or a host name, which should be tagged as
\cd{Data}. The description also defines a helper function \cd{is_node},
which returns true if the data item in question is a host name
rather than a comment.  Given this specification, the \cd{nodes} feed
logically yields a list of host names and comments every two minutes.
In fact, because of the possibility of errors, the feed actually
delivers a {\em list option} every two minutes: \cd{Some} if the list is
populated with data, \cd{None} if the data was unavailable at the
given time-slice.

Using the \cd{nodes} specification, we define the \cd{comon} feed as a
\textit{dependent} feed: each \cd{nodelist} in the \cd{nodes} feed defines a
collection of sources for the \cd{comon} feed.  The \cd{comon} \kw{source}
specification processes the \cd{nodelist} to manage errors and strip
out comment fields.  The code that handles this processing illustrates
that the \padsd{} domain-specific language is embedded in \ocaml{}.
We use \ocaml{} terms where necessary to specify simple
transformations.  In particular, the \cd{current} function checks if
the \cd{nodelist} is \cd{None}, signalling a fetching error, in which
case it uses the most recently cached list of nodes instead.  The
\kw{source} specification filters out comment fields, and then
converts the host names to URLs with the required port using the
auxiliary function \cd{makeURL}.  The \kw{schedule} for this CoMon
feed is \cd{once} (with a timeout of sixty seconds) because we want to
collect the data for each host in a given \cd{hostlist} just once.
The \kw{foreach ... create} construct merges the resulting data from
each machine into a single feed.  As
before, the format of data fetched from each node matches the
description \cd{Comon\_format.Source}.  

With this specification, we
expect to get data from all the active machines listed in the
configuration file every two minutes.  We further expect the system to
notices changes in the configuration file within two minutes.

The previous examples all showcased feeds that contained a single type
of data.  \padsd{} also provides a datatype mechanism that allows us
to construct compound feeds containing data of different sorts.  As an
example where such a construct is useful, the CoMon system includes a
number of administrative data sources.  One example is a collection of
node profiles, collecting the domain name, IP address, physical
location, \etc, for each node in the cluster.  A second example is a
list of authentication information for logging into the machines.
These two data sources have different formats, locations, and update
schedules, but system administrators want to keep a combined archive
of the administrative information present in these sources.  If
\cd{sites\_mime} is a feed description of the profile
information and \cd{sites\_keyscan\_mime} is a feed of authentication
information, then the declaration

\begin{code}
\kw{feed} sites = 
    Locale \kw{of} sites_mime
  | Keyscan \kw{of} sites_keyscan_mime
\end{code}
%
creates a feed with elements drawn from each of the two 
feeds.  The constructors \cd{Locale} and \cd{Keyscan} tag each item in
the compound feed to indicate its source. 

% \subsection{\vizGems{} Example}
% We now shift to an example drawn from AT\&T's \vizGems{} project.  Like
% the earlier CoMon example, the \cd{stats} feed in \figref{fig:pulse}
% monitors a collection of machines described in a configuration file.
% The \cd{hostList} description has the same form as the \cd{nodes} feed
% we saw earlier, except it draws the data from a local file and only
% once a day.  Unlike the earlier example, we use a \textit{feed
% comprehension} to clean up this feed before creating the \cd{stats} feed.
% The comprehension filters
% the list of hosts to remove comments using the \cd{is_node} function
% and we use the built-in \cd{flatten} function to convert the feed of
% lists of hosts into a simple feed of hosts.  We use the \cd{mk\_host}
% function to remove the \cd{Data} constructor around the hostnames to
% simplify down-stream processing.

% The \cd{stats} feed depends upon the \cd{hosts} feed.  For each host
% \cd{h} in \cd{hosts}, it creates a schedule consisting of a single
% time corresponding to ``now'' with a timeout of one minute.  It uses
% this schedule \cd{s} to describe a compound feed, which pairs two base
% feeds: the first uses the Unix command \cd{ping} to collect network
% statistics about the remote machine while the second performs a remote
% shell invocation using \cd{ssh} to find out statistics about how long
% the machine has been up.  Both of these feeds use the \kw{proc}
% constructor in the \kw{sources} field to compute the data on the fly,
% rather than reading it from a file.  The argument to \kw{proc} is a
% string that is executed in a freshly constructed shell.  The pairing
% constructor for feeds takes a pair of feeds and returns a feed of
% pairs, with elements sharing the same scheduled fetch time being
% paired. This semantics is very convenient in this case, as it produces
% a feed that for each host returns a pair of its ping and uptime
% statistics, grouping together the information for each host. 
% Of course, the full \vizGems{} monitoring application
% uses many more tools than just ping and uptime to probe the remote
% machine; the corresponding feed description has many more branches than this simplified version.

\subsection{\vizGems{} Example}
We now shift to an example drawn from AT\&T's \vizGems{} project.  Like
the earlier CoMon example, the \cd{stats} feed in \figref{fig:pulse2}
monitors a collection of machines described in a configuration file.
Before we discuss the \cd{stats} feed itself, we first explain some
auxiliary feeds that we use in the definition of the \cd{stats} feed.   

The \cd{raw\_hostLists} description has the same form as the \cd{nodes}
feed we saw earlier, except it draws the data from a local file once a
day.  We use a \textit{feed comprehension} to define a clean
version of the feed, \cd{host\_lists}.  In the comprehension, the
built-in predicate \cd{is\_good} verifies that no errors occured in
fetching the current list of machines \cd{hl}, as would be expected
for a local file.  The function \cd{get\_hosts} takes \cd{hl} and uses
the built-in function \cd{get\_good} to unwrap the payload data from
the error infrastructure, an operation that is guaranteed to succeed
because of the \cd{is\_good} guard. The function \cd{get_hosts} then
selects the host name entries and unwraps them to produce a list of
unadorned host names.   

We next define a feed generator \cd{gen_stats} that yields an
integrated feed of performance statistics for each supplied host.  In
more detail, when given a host \cd{h}, \cd{gen_stats} creates a five
minute schedule with a one minute timeout. It then uses this schedule
to describe a compound feed, which pairs two base feeds: the first
uses the Unix command \cd{ping} to collect network statistics about
the route to \cd{h} while the second performs a remote shell
invocation using \cd{ssh} to gather statistics about how long the
machine has been up.  Both of these feeds use the \kw{proc}
constructor in the \kw{sources} field to compute the data on the fly,
rather than reading it from a file.  The argument to \kw{proc} is a
string that the system executes in a freshly constructed shell.  The
pairing constructor for feeds takes a pair of feeds and returns a feed
of pairs, with elements sharing the same scheduled fetch-time being
paired. This semantics conveniently produces a compound feed that for
each host returns a pair of its ping and uptime statistics, grouping
together the information for each host.  Of course, the full
\vizGems{} monitoring application uses many more tools than just ping
and uptime to probe remote machines; the full feed description has
many more branches than this simplified version. 


%% For each list of hosts in the
%% \cd{host_lists} feed, we generate a {\em feed of lists} using 
Finally, we define the feed \cd{stats}.  The most interesting element
of this declaration is the use of a
{\em list feed comprehension} to generate a {\em feed of lists}.
The list feed comprehension, given in square
brackets, specifies a list of feeds (one feed per host \cd{h} in the
current host list \cd{hl} in this case)
and then converts the result back into a feed of lists, with one
list per time instant in the declared schedule.  
Hence, for every time $\atime$, the list feed comprehension 
declared here packages all statistics for all hosts into a single list.
Generating such a structure makes it easy for a programmer to iterate over the
resulting stream, performing one action over all data gathered at
each time step.  It is a great relief to be able to avoid having to
implement one's own multi-way synchronization.

Once the list feed comprehension is defined, 
the \kw{foreach...} \kw{update} is just gravy -- it generates one feed 
of lists from the first host list \cd{hl} until the next host
list \cd{hl}' scheduled, at which point it terminates the \cd{hl} feed
and switches over generating
a feed from \cd{hl}'.  Notice the subtle difference between
\kw{foreach...create}, which generates a collection of feeds and
merges all contents of all generated feeds, and \kw{foreach...update}
which generates a collection of feeds but truncates one as the next
appears.  Such details are somewhat difficult to describe completely
precisely in words, but eager readers may skip ahead to
Section~\ref{sec:semantics} to find such details in our formal
semantics.

% construct then merges this list of
% feeds into a single feed with data for all the hosts.  This merged
% feed delivers values for a given host list \cd{hl} until the next host
% list \cd{hl}' arrives from the feed \cd{host\_lists}, at which point
% it stops collecting data from the feeds generated from \cd{hl} and
% starts gathering data from the machines in \cd{hl}'.

% With this specification, we expect the system to return data for each
% machine listed in the configuration file every five minutes.  We will
% notice changes in the configuration file once a day.
