\paragraph*{Intellectual Merits:} 

Complex systems must be {\em monitored} to proactively find problems,
record/archive system health, oversee system operation, detect
malicious processes or security violations and perform a myriad of
other tasks.  Unfortunately, application developers may lack the time
or discipline to create monitoring tools and update them as necessary
as the underlying applications change. As a result, complex systems
are often under-monitored, and can fail in ways that the monitoring
system cannot observe and help diagnose.

A unified {\em monitoring infrastructure} to perform such tasks should
be able to include embedded sensors that monitor physical processes,
machine-level monitors to manage server infrastructure, intrusion
detection systems that monitor network traffic, application-level
monitors that can observe applications within a system. Monitoring
should be able to span multiple such systems, spread across a facility
or multiple locations.

The goal of our research is to perform whole-system monitoring for
complex systems, including the development of automated application
monitoring and anomaly detection, for both small-scale and wide-area
systems. Our approach consists of three components: (1) a
non-intrusive application traffic sniffer that performs automated
characterization and analysis, (2) a high-level language, called PADS,
capable of specifying the data that monitoring systems accumulate,
archive, and present to users, and (3) a scalable monitoring system,
CoMon, that can adaptively present new data sources and allow
operators to analyze and visualize data across multiple domains.

This approach addresses a number of shortcomings of modern monitoring
systems. Automated format inference and parsing of ad-hoc data allows
application data to be sniffed on the wire, without having to modify
applications. PADS provides a comprehensive system for describing data
in its native formats, and automatically generating tools to access
the data, both for live and archival data. CoMon works with PADS to
interactively present the data to operators, allowing them to query
it, view it graphically, and analyze trends on the data, without having
to provide manual configuration of the database.

Our decision to move away from manual parsing not only simplifies the
system, but it also provides flexibility and security that
hand-written parsers used for monitoring do not provide.  Given a
high-level specification, either provided by the operator or inferred
from the data, the PADS compiler will automatically generate a
collection of reliable, secure, and high-performance libraries as well
as stand-alone tools that perform all of the basic functions of a
monitoring system including concurrently {\em fetching} data from any
number of distributed sources, {\em archiving} (self-describing) data
for later analysis, {\em querying} data to troubleshoot problems, and
{\em displaying} statistical data summaries so users can monitor
system health in real time.  Moreover, as system requirements change
and evolve, implementers may make simple changes to the high-level
specifications and recompile to automatically obtain an improved
monitoring system.  In addition, since code is automatically
generated, as opposed to hand-written, it will not contain
vulnerabilities that make other systems susceptible to buffer
overflows and related attacks.  Finally, since PADS will have the
ability to describe the format of any data source, users will be able
to automatically generate monitoring tools that interoperate with
legacy software, legacy data and legacy devices.  Hence, our research
has the potential to have an immediate impact on the productivity of
systems implementers and to produce the next generation of monitoring
systems.  Overall, our research will combine principled and innovative
language design with high-performance systems engineering, all aimed
at solving pervasive systems monitoring and measurement problems.

\paragraph*{Broader Impacts:}  Kathleen Fisher, senior personnel, 
will work with other researchers at AT\&T to transfer our monitoring
technology to industry.  In addition, we will develop tools for
monitoring the health of PlanetLab, a global network research testbed
with 400-450 nodes and 200-250 network experiments running at any
given time.  Not only will our troubleshooting and diagnostic tools
will provide feedback to PlanetLab users and administrators, thereby
improving PlanetLab as a research facility for the entire networking
community, but these same tools will easily usable by individual
researchers to monitor their own experiments on PlanetLab. In effect,
we can provide a complete system to archive history, analyze data, and
present demonstrations, all from a simple data description.

PADS will also make a broad impact outside the networking community.
The kind of {\em ad hoc data} found in monitoring systems also appears
across the natural and social sciences, including biology, chemistry,
physics and economics.  The PADS specification language will be used to
specify the formats of these other data sources and to generate the
querying and visualization tools that help improve
the productivity of computational scientists.  To jumpstart this
research, we have already been meeting with Olga Troyanskaya,
professor in Princeton's Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative
Genomics, who does computational analysis of protein-protein
interactions, and with Rachel Mandelbaum, Ph.D. candidate in physics
who analyzes cosmology data.  It is clear that if funded, the PADS system
will make a broad impact on their research --- PADS will free them to use
their world-class skills on their {\em science} 
as opposed to labouring over development of data processing tools.
The collaboration between computer science, genomics and physics will
also be an excellent platform for developing interdisciplinary
undergraduate research projects.  The PI has a proven track-record for
following through with undergraduate and graduate educational plans.
In 2004 and 2005, he organized NSF-sponsored summer schools on secure
and reliable computing.  Last year, his undergraduate student advisee,
Rob Simmons, won the Princeton Computer Science Senior Thesis Award.
