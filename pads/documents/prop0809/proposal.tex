\section{Management Approach}

\subsection{Facilities available}

The Princeton Department of Computer Science has hundreds of
PC/workstations running a variety of operating systems including
Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, and Solaris. (A total of 1800 IP
addresses.) Every room in the CS building is wired with multiple
Category 5/5e UTP ports, single-mode fiber, multimode fiber, and RG6
coaxial cable. Networking is supported by a high-speed core switch
with an aggregate switching bandwidth of 480 Gb/sec. Typically,
servers are connected via gigabit Ethernet and user PC/workstations
are connected via switched 100 Mb/sec Ethernet. The Princeton
Department of Computer Science supports remote users via the Internet
and ADSL. The entire building and some outlying areas are covered by
the department's 802.11a/b/g wireless network. The department
infrastructure and users are protected by firewalls, e-mail virus/spam
scanners, and an IDS system. The public computing facilities provide
access to Sun Solaris (Sparc) and Linux (x86) architectures. Public
printers are available on each floor. The department has approximately
800 users that share 35 terabytes of disk space on multiple
fileservers.

\subsection{Collaboration Framework}

Vivek Pai will be primarily responsible for the networking components,
data transfer and archiving components of the proposal.  He will
supervise students and postdoctoral researchers working on these
elements of the grant.  Walker and Fisher
have a 4-year history of working closely together on the design
and implementation of domain-specific languages, as well as on joint
supervision of students.  They will meet weekly over the phone
in order to coordinate the development of \pads{} language and system
as well as the development of format inference and tool generation 
technologies.  They will jointly supervise students and postdoctoral
researchers working on language design and format inference components
of the research.

\section{Qualifications}

Our team is uniquely qualified to carry out this research as they
bring the necessary combination of skills in language design,
compilers, distributed systems, large-scale data processing, and
practical system monitoring as well as both academic and industrial
perspectives to the task.  

Kathleen Fisher is a senior researcher at AT\&T Labs,
where she has spent the past nine years on projects
related to managing massive amounts of ad hoc network monitoring data.
In the Hancock project~\cite{kdd00,hancock-toplas}, she helped 
design and implement a C-based
domain-specific programming language for processing massive  
transaction streams.  Hancock programs make it easy to build
and maintain profiles of the entities described in such streams. 
AT\&T uses these profiles to monitor networks for fraud 
and to better understand user characteristics.
As the primary architect of the PADS project~\cite{fisher+:pads}, 
Fisher has helped design and implement the prototype PADS
data description language that will form a foundation for the work
described in this proposal.  
%From PADS descriptions,
%a compiler currently produces a parser and a collection of tools for
%manipulating the associated data.  

Vivek Pai is an expert in the
design and implementation of network applications, having developed
numerous high-performance applications running over
PlanetLab~\cite{planetlab} including CoDeeN~\cite{codeen}, a content
distribution network in daily use that serves over 25 million
requests per day, CoBlitz~\cite{coblitz}, a scalable large-file
transfer platform that is currently used by CiteSeer and as
a Fedora Core mirror, CoDNS~\cite{codns}, a highly reliable,
high-performance DNS lookup system, and PlanetSeer~\cite{planetseer},
a monitor for CoDeeN traffic that looks for network-level anomalies.

David Walker is an expert in language-based security and programming
language design.  He was one of the primary designers and implementers
of Typed Assembly Language~\cite{morrisett+:tal,morrisett+:journal-stal}, 
a highly influential platform
for secure mobile code, as well as Polymer~\cite{bauer+:polymer,ligatti+:renewal,ligatti+:edit-automata}, an
extension to Java for application-level security monitoring.  He has
collaborated with Fisher on the design and implementation of the
\pads{} domain-specific language, which forms the foundation for
the research in this proposal.

Please find CVs outlining the personnel qualifications in detail attached.
