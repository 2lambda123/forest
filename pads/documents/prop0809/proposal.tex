\section{Qualifications}

\paragraph*{Kathleen Fisher, Senior Personnel} 
Kathleen Fisher is a senior researcher at AT\&T Labs,
where she has spent the past nine years on projects
related to managing massive amounts of ad hoc network monitoring data.
In the Hancock project~\cite{kdd00,hancock-toplas}, she helped 
design and implement a C-based
domain-specific programming language for processing massive  
transaction streams.  Hancock programs make it easy to build
and maintain profiles of the entities described in such streams. 
AT\&T uses these profiles to monitor networks for fraud 
and to better understand user characteristics.
As the primary architect of the PADS project~\cite{fisher+:pads}, 
Fisher has helped design and implement the prototype PADS
data description language that will form a foundation for the work
described in this proposal.  From PADS descriptions,
a compiler currently produces a parser and a collection of tools for
manipulating the associated data.  

Fisher is an active proponent of increasing the role of women and
minorities in computing and has obtained NSF funding to support
increased involvement of women in computer science (NSF 0243337, ACM
Special Projects: Travel Grants for Faculty at Minority/Female
Institutions to Attend FCRC'03, Co-PI).  This grant was committed to
improving the representation of women and minorities in computer
science. To that end, Fisher and her collaborators 
solicited applications for travel grants from
faculty members at undergraduate institutions with large minority
and/or female enrollments to attend FCRC '03, an umbrella meeting with
16 constituent conferences and many associated workshops and
tutorials.  The organizers of the constituent meetings agreed to waive
the registration fees for all program participants.  Descriptions of
the many meetings that comprised FCRC '03 are available from the FCRC
'03 web site \url{http://www.acm.org/sigs/conferences/fcrc/}.  Fisher
received 56 applications, and was able to award 49 fellowships.

\paragraph*{Vivek Pai, Co-PI} Vivek Pai was partially funded by 
an NSF CAREER award, CCR-0093351, Automatic Retargeting of Network
Servers. He is currently Co-PI on CNS-0520053, An Evolvable
Architecture for Next-Generation Internet Services, and PI on
CNS-0519829 Bridging the 10 GHz / 10 Gbit Gap: Whole-system approaches
for scalable networked services.

His CAREER award led to the enhancement of the Flash Web Server to
support SpecWeb99, an industry-standard benchmark not commonly used in
the academic community due to its complexity. The main result of this
work is an improved research server that is at or near the top of the
results for this benchmark for the classes of hardware tested. In the
process, his group developed new kernel performance debugging tools
that identified numerous performance problems in the FreeBSD operating
system. The modifications they developed to address these problems
have been integrated into FreeBSD and have been shipping for over a
year.  The work also lead to a better understanding of server
performance in SMT (simultaneous multithreading) processors, and why
these processors are not seeing the performance gains in practice that
would have been expected from their simulations.

The two more recent awards have just started, but are already starting
to bear fruit. One recent service developed from this, CoBlitz, is a
scalable large-file transfer service that runs over HTTP. CoBlitz is
now being used by the CiteSeer Scientific Literature Digital Library
to globally deliver electronic copies of research publications. It is
also being used by the Fedora Core Linux distribution in delivering
CD-ISO and DVD-ISO images of their OS distribution.

\paragraph*{David Walker, PI} (NSF CCR-0238328 CAREER: Programming Languages for Secure and Reliable Component Software
Systems, PI)
The goal of Walker's career award is to develop new programming language
technology that will improve the security and reliability of 
component software systems.  More specifically, Walker and his students have 
a new theory of security monitors as formal
automata that transform untrusted applications as they 
execute~\cite{ligatti+:edit-automata}.
This theory allows security
architects to model a variety of different sorts of run-time
enforcement mechanisms, to prove that certain mechanisms can or cannot
enforce various security properties, and to compare the power of
different classes of security monitors~\cite{ligatti+:renewal}.
The theory forms the foundation of an expressive and powerful
program monitoring system for Java~\cite{bauer+:polymer}.

Walker's security monitoring language is a form of 
aspect-oriented programming language.
In order to better understand aspect-oriented technologies and their
potential impact on security, Walker formalized and proved
safe the {\em first} typed, functional and 
aspect-oriented programming language~\cite{walker+:aspects}.
The language has been implemented and
extended with facilities for polymorphic
and type-directed programming~\cite{dantas+:polyaml}.  
Recently, Walker has studied program analysis techniques
that can precisely determine the effect security monitors have on
the code they monitor~\cite{dantas+:harmless-advice,dantas+:harmless-popl}.   
The analysis
can guarantee that a security monitor does not interfere with the 
original application, which greatly increases a user's incentive
to apply security patches.

% To complement his work on run-time monitoring programs, Walker has also
% developed several type systems to ensure basic type and memory safety conditions
% for low-level programs.  Basic type- and memory-safety guarantees provide a foundation on which
% richer security mechanisms can be implemented.  More specifically, he
% has extended his earlier work on typed assembly language (TAL)~\cite{morrisett+:tal,morrisett+:journal-stal} with
% logic-based type systems that can detect memory errors involving
% stack-allocated data~\cite{ahmed+:stack,jia+:stack} and heap or region-allocated
% data~\cite{ahmed+:hierarchical-storage}.  In addition to studying memory safety
% properties, Walker has shown how to use related type-theoretic and logical techniques
% to verify programs~\cite{jia+:ilc} and enforce general software
% protocols~\cite{mandelbaum+:refinements}.  

Walker's career grant also allowed him to be a leader in
programming languages and security education. In 2004 and 2005 he
organized a 10-day summer school on software security and reliable
computing, attended by over 100 participants
combined~\cite{summerschool04,summerschool05}.  Also
in 2005, his undergraduate research advisee, Rob Simmons, won the
Princeton Computer Science Department Senior Thesis Award.
He has recently written a
chapter of a new textbook on typed programming 
languages~\cite{walker:attapl}.
