% \begin{abstract}  

% %   Massive amounts of useful data are stored and processed in
% %   \textit{ad hoc} formats for which common tools like parsers,
% %   printers, query engines and format converters are not readily
% %   available.  In this paper, we explain the semantics of \padsml{}, a new language and
% %   system that facilitates generation of data processing tools for ad
% %   hoc formats.  The \padsml{} design includes features such as
% %   dependent, polymorphic and recursive datatypes, which allow
% %   programmers to describe the syntax and semantics of ad hoc data in a
% %   concise, easy-to-read notation.  The \padsml{} theory
% %   gives a precise formal meaning to the descriptions in terms of the
% %   semantics of parsing, the semantics of printing, and the types of
% %   data structures that represent parsed data.

%   In previous work, we presented \ddcold{}, a semantic framework for
%   understanding {\em Data Description Languages}, a class of
%   domain-specific languages for declaratively describing data formats
%   for the purpose of automatically constructing format-specific
%   data-processing tools. In this paper, we present \ddc{}, which
%   extends \ddcold{} in two directions. First, we have added
%   ``polymorphic'' types -- or, types parameterized by types, and
%   significantly revised the metatheory in order to account for
%   semantics. Second, we have defined the semantics of printers
%   for \ddc{}, thereby specifying more completely the relationship
%   between raw data and in-memory data, for any given format described
%   in \ddc{}.
