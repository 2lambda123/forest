\begin{abstract}  

%   Massive amounts of useful data are stored and processed in
%   \textit{ad hoc} formats for which common tools like parsers,
%   printers, query engines and format converters are not readily
%   available.  In this paper, we explain the semantics of \padsml{}, a new language and
%   system that facilitates generation of data processing tools for ad
%   hoc formats.  The \padsml{} design includes features such as
%   dependent, polymorphic and recursive datatypes, which allow
%   programmers to describe the syntax and semantics of ad hoc data in a
%   concise, easy-to-read notation.  The \padsml{} theory
%   gives a precise formal meaning to the descriptions in terms of the
%   semantics of parsing, the semantics of printing, and the types of
%   data structures that represent parsed data.

  In previous work, we presented \ddcold{}, a semantic framework for
  understanding {\em Data Description Languages}, a class of
  domain-specific languages for declaratively describing data formats
  for the purpose of automatically constructing format-specific
  data-processing tools. In this paper, we present \ddc{}, which
  extends \ddcold{} in two directions. First, we have added
  ``polymorphic'' types -- or, types parameterized by types, and
  significantly revised the metatheory in order to account for
  semantics. Second, we have defined the semantics of printers
  for \ddc{}, thereby specifying more completely the relationship
  between raw data and in-memory data, for any given format described
  in \ddc{}.
