\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclude}

Ad hoc data is unpredictable, poorly documented, filled with errors, 
and yet ubiquitous.  It poses tremendous challenges to the data analysts
that must analyze, vet and transform it into useful information.
Our goal is to alleviate the burden, risk and confusion associated 
with ad hoc data by using the declarative \pads{} language and system.

In this paper, we describe our 
continuing efforts to develop an format inference engine for 
the \pads{} language. In particular, 
we show how to redesign our format inference algorithm
so that it can take advantage of information 
generated from an arbitrary statistical token model and we
study the effectiveness of three different candidate models,
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Hierarchical Maximum Entropy Models
(HMEMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
We show that each model in succession is somewhat more
accurate than the last, at least in certain cases.  However, 
no model is perfect and each suffers from a rather substantial
performance cost.  We hope that over time, as we write more
\pads{} descriptions by hand and gather more training data, 
the results will continue to improve.
