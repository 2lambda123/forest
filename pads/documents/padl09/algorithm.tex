\section{High-level Algorithm}\label{sec:algo}
\begin{verbatim}
1. (way ahead of time) train a statistical model over the training data
2. (at inference time) coarse-grain tokenization (i.e. finding Seqsets)
3a. run the statistical model over the user data, and use the (modified) 
    viterbi algorithm to find the most likely sequences
3b. populate histograms based on the most likely sequences
3c select candidate histograms + structure, according to heuristics
3d. break down Seqsets using not just the most likely sequences
3e. recursively repeat, go to 3a.
4. apply rewriting involving blob finding to maximize the information 
   theoretic complexity score
5. print description & construct resulting tools

We'll compose this algorithm by figure and explain it with running examples 
in Section 2.
