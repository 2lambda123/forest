- problem in general : tools
- problem specified in POPL paper : Token Ambiguity Problem
- solution
  - statistical methods to deal with it
  - re-work to build algorithm
    - multiple token sequences: DAG
    - most likely sequences (with certain constraints to make sure 
      the token sequences are legal) 
       => histograms
    - subdivision algorithm
      - to select less likely sequences if the most likely sequence 
        doesn't satisfy some constraints, or it's broken by cutting the DAG
    - blob finding
