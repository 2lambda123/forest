talk notes:
 example may have take too long.

 should we describe in-memory rep of unions and/or arrays
 discuss string rep, copying issues (tbd)

  how to give feedback on the source of costs of different 
configuration choices.

dgk&gsf
 make no-copy the standard, provide operation to make
things "safe" to preserve across record-boundaries.
  - what is the default for a no-rec discipline?

hume:
  data exchange documentation

  interactions between various streams: constraints
  across streams

  consume multiple streams at once to find areas of interest
  pattern matching with time ranges to limit search

  recursive parsing shouldn't be a problem for record-based data.

  no-copy versions have to be careful about alignment.
  variable-width data is probably pre-processed into binary data with
  appropriate alignment (using padding where necessary).
****************************************************
 should be able to set aspects of disiplines by declarations in pads
  files. (or command-line, or environment variable, etc.)
  def of record, white space treatment
  endianness, machine word size

 should have slurp white space

described bank format,
SWIFT industry standard for content, but not representation

fixed-width records
fields specify padding and alignment within record
earlier records can determine format of later records,
  nested goes quite deep.

is the author of a tape management system that included
the ability to do streaming operations specified in a
language that has some similarity to PADS spec language.
his work might be a useful reference for you.

--------
you should also talk to Flip Korn and Ted Johnson.
they are real (and local) experts about streaming databases.

dec 4 at 10 is fine.

I wrote a tool, Bellman, for exploring complex databases.
A visiting student, Vladislav Shkapenyuk,
wrote a mini version for daytona.
I'd be happy to show these to you, it might give
some ideas.

My bigger interest these days is gigascope,
a stream database for packet monitoring.
there is a nearly up-to-date manual at
        http://www.research.att.com/~johnsont/
The interesting issue is to write protocol adaptors more easily.

I have Bellman posted here also.
