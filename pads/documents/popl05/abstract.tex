In the spirit of Landin, we present a calculus of dependent types to
serve as the semantic foundation for a family of languages called
\textit{data description languages}.  Such languages, which include
\pads{}, \datascript{}, and \packettypes{}, are designed to facilitate
programming with \textit{ad hoc data}, \ie{}, data not in well-behaved
relational or \xml{} formats. In the calculus, each type describes the
physical layout and semantic properties of a data source. In the
semantics, we interpret the types simultaneously as the in-memory
representation for the data described and as parsing functions for the
data source. The parsing functions are robust, automatically detecting
and recording errors in the data stream without halting parsing.  We
prove two correctness properties of the parsers.  First, we show they
are type-correct, outputing data whose type matches the simple-type
interpretation of the specification, and second, we show they are
``error-correct,'' accurately reporting the number of physical and
semantic errors that occur in the returned data.  We use the calculus
to describe the features of various data description languages, and we
discuss how we have used the calculus to improve the \pads{} language.
