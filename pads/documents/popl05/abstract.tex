  We present a calculus of dependent types that can be used
  compositionally to describe the physical layout and semantic
  properties of a data source. We present a semantics for the calculus
  in which we interpret the types simultaneously as the simple types
  for the data described and as parsing functions for the data source.
  The parsing functions are robust, automatically detecting and
  recording errors in the data stream without halting parsing.  We
  prove two important correctness properties of the parsers.  First,
  we show they are type-correct, outputing data whose type matches the
  simple-type interpretation of the specificatIon, and second, we show
  they are ``error-correct,'' reporting exactly the number of physical
  and semantic errors that occur in the returned data. Finally, we
  present a case study of using this calculus to describe the PADS
  language.
