{\em PEG difference: not just dependency, but error handling?}

To our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to specify a semantics for
data description languages. Therefore, most closely related to our
work are the data description languages themselves, discussed in the
introduction.  However, there are certainly alternative formalisms for
defining langauges, perhaps most notably, regular expressions and
contex-free grammars. Unfortunately, the nondeterminism and lack of
dependency in these formalisms limit their suitability to formalizing
data description languages. While the parsing expression grammars
(PEG) formalism~\cite{ford:parsing-expression-grammars} is
significantly closer to the \ddc{}, it too lacks the necessary
dependency.

Less related, but still relevant, are Haskell's parsing
combinators. While these are not a formalism, they do provide an
elegant manner in which to express parsers. Hence, while we chose to
define our parsing semantics in the polymorphic lambda calculus,they
potentialy provide a more elegant alternative.

{\em Mention dependent type theory work?}
