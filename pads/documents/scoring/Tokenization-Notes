1. Need to catch up with nummonth / genmonth distinction
2. Should we define year as:
year = 19[0-9]{2} | 20[0-9]{2}

this would reduce the number of possible years from 3000 to 200.

3. Do all urls begin with http:// ? Aren't there any of the form www.galois.com,
or just galois.com?

4. The filename token is defined using the caret (^) as [^\\/?*:<>"]+; If I
understand correctly this means everything but the list enclosed in square
brackets, which lists the eight characters \, /, ?, *, :, <, >, and ". My
question is, what is the universal set from which we are subtracting? Is it
all printable ASCII characters, or is it all 256 possible characters?

5. For tokens such as hostname, there is a separator character such as ".".
The separators should "count less" than other characters. Right now I am
subtracting the number of separators from the length of the token. However,
there is still some entropy in the placement and number of the separators,
I do not have a good idea for how to include this in the calculation.

6. For TBD and Bottom, I am computing the maximum complexity from the
context list. Is this a suitable measure?

7. I am computing unit complexity for the Pgroup token, lacking any better
ideas. What is a reasonable complexity here?

8. I am computing unit complexity for Pempty and Error tokens. Is this OK?

9. I will update the computation of the RefinedBase type "Enum" to include
a term for the number of different choices in the enumeration.

10. The port token allows any integer that begins with 1 through 9. The
maximum port number should be 65535. Perhaps we can redefine it as

port = [1-9] | [1-9][0-9] | [1-9][0-9][0-9] | [1-9][0-9][0-9][0-9] | [1-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]

This would reduce the number of possibilities to 100,000.
