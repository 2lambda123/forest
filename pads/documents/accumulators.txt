pads.c:
Contains definitions of accumulator functions for each base
type. The definitions are grouped into type families: integer, fpoint,
floats, etc.   For each family and each operation, there is a macro
that generates an instance for the operation for each member of the
family.

pads.h:
Contains the public prototypes for all base type accumulator
functions. 

pads-internal.h:
Contains prototypes for base type accumulators
functions that are only used internally. 

pads-impl.h
Contains macros to define acc_report2xml_io functions for various date
and time formats in terms of PDCI_date_time_acc_report2io function
defined in pads.c

cnv-ext.sml
Contains the bulk of the compiler.  For each declaration, it generates
all functions specific to the declared type.  There is a section for
accumulator related functions within the code to process each type. 
The code for histograms and cluster analysis has been factored into
files cluster.sml and hist.sml, but the analysis code is still in
cnv-ext.sml  Many useful support routines appear in build-utils.sml.
The files hist.sml and cluster.sml share these rountes.
