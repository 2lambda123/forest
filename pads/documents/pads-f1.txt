PADS: Processing Arbitrary Data Streams
---------------------------------------
Joint work with [Kathleen Fisher|Bob Gruber]

Data feeds are the lifeblood of many highly valuable AT&T research
projects.  The goal of the PADS project is to provide languages and
tools for simplifying data stream processing.  We have a preliminary
design of a declarative data-description language, PADSL, expressive
enough to describe the data feeds used by AT&T, including ASCII,
binary, and mixed data.  From PADSL we generate a tunable C library
with functions for parsing, manipulating, and summarizing the data.
The library is immediately useful for those who write C programs to
analzye data.  Our next steps include using the library as input to
tools that query and aggregate data.

The PADS project provides a common meeting ground to bring together
the tools and knowledge of many other researchers.  Some specific
examples:

  * We're working with Andrew Hume on fast characterization
    of data files that have COBOL codebooks.  Hume is working on a
    codebook to PADSL tool.

  * We plan to work with Mary Fernandez on querying PADS-parsed data
    using XML-query, *without* materializing the data
    as XML data.

  * We are meeting with Ted Johnson (HB84) to explore incorporation of his
    data summary and correlation work.

  * We plan to support statisticians such as David Poole with scripting
    tools, so that they can express queries and desired plots declaratively,
    in one place, and automatically get parsing, filtering, and input into S+
    analysis and plotting -- no coding required.

Finally, by providing a means of describing all of Research's incoming
data streams using a common language, we open the possibility of
correlating and integrating the data from these streams.
