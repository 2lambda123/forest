\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
We have presented an incremental algorithm for infering system log
formats.  We experimentally verified that this algorithm can produce
quality descriptions within minutes when run on files with hundreds of
thousands of lines.  As future work, we intend to explore several
additional paths to improve the quality and performance of format
inference. First, our experience suggests that the quality of
the final output and the efficiency of parsing is very sensitive to
the quality of the initial description.  Hence, we plan to work on
improving the original \learnpads{} algorithm to produce better
initial descriptions. Second, despite the various optimization efforts
we put in the system, parsing can still be inefficient, especially for
complex descriptions.  We intend to explore using speculative
parallelism to improve the efficiency of the \cd{parse\_all} function,
which would directly improve the overall efficiency of the algorithm.
