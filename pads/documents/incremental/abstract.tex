System logs come in a large variety of formats. Many of the formats are semi-structured and
non-standard, hence no tools or libraries are readily available to analyze and process them.
In this paper, we propose an incremental algorithm that automatically infers the format of
system log files, and generates a suites of useful data processing tools. The main advantage of
the system is that it is capable of handling large scale, continuous data, and it allows user
interaction to correct or improve the learned description of the format incrementally.
