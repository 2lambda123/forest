 - ai.3000 example

 - PADS description

 - How LearnPADS works

 - LearnPADS Limitations: 
	1) main-memory algo can't handle very large data sources
        2) formats learned from a subset of data may not be correct (ai.3000 with a POST)
	3) can't handle continuous data
	4) formats learned can be un-intuitive (needs some human guidance)

 - hence we developed the incremental learning algorithm
