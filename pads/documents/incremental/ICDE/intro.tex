\section{Introduction}
Ad hoc data is any {\em non-standard}, {\em semi-structured} 
data sources for which no processing tools or libraries are 
readily available. HTML/XML data is not ad hoc data because 
they are standard, delimited by tags, and there
are many tools and manuals written for them; relational databases 
are also not ad hoc data because they are structured. 
Despite efforts to standardize data formats such as using XML 
as a data exchange mechanism, ad hoc data still persists
in many domains ranging from computer system administration to 
financial transaction to health care to computational biology. Figure 
\ref{fig:adhoc} shows fragments of two ad hoc data sources.
People continue to produce and use ad hoc data because they 
are expedient to output and more compact to store.  
Typical use of these data sources includes system fault monitoring
by looking at vital system health parameters in the system logs,
intrusion detection by matching access patterns to intrusion
models and data mining of scientific and financial data.

Despite the convenience to produce ad hoc data, these
data formats become very difficult to deal with because of missing
documentation, lack of tools, and corruptions caused by
repeated redesign and re-engineering over time. 
In the past, ad hoc data analysis usually involved
writing a shell script or a wrapper programs to parse each 
individual data formats, which is expensive, error-prone and 
hard to maintain. 

The \pads{} project \cite{padsweb} aims at solving some of the above 
problems. The central technology is a declarative, type-based 
data description language that allows the user to specify the physical
layout of the data sources as well as some semantics among the data
values. The specification can then be compiled into a suite of
processing tools such as a statistical reporting tool, an 
XML converter and a query engine, and programming libraries 
including parser, printer and traversal functions. 

A significant impediment to using \pads{} is the need to learn
a new language and the amount of efforts to
hand craft \pads{} descriptions, which can be very time consuming
especially when the data format is complex or the data source is
very large. These efforts are significantly increased if the data
formats are evolving and the descriptions have to be updated 
frequently. For example, when analyzing large amount of Cisco router
logs at AT\&T, we noticed that the format changes once after the first 2GB, 
and then again after another few GBs. The sudden change in format is
the result of router firmware upgrades.

The tremendous scale as well as the streaming and evolving nature of many ad hoc
sources led us to believe that a system which automatically {\em learns}
the \pads{} description of a given data source and incrementally updates that
description as the source evolves will significantly reduce the barrier for
using \pads{} and also further improve the productivity of ad hoc data users.
As a first step, we developed an unsupervised algorithm \learnpads{}
\cite{Fisher+:dirttoshovels,fisher+:sigmod08}
that automatically infers the \pads{} description of a sample data source by 
computing the statistics of {\em tokens} in the data and using an information
theretical score to optimize the description. This algorithm, however,
requires all data to be pre-loaded into main memory and contains procedures 
that are quadratic to the size of data, 
and therefore cannot scale to very large scale data. 

In this paper, we propose a new framework that automatically infers 
descriptions of large scale or continuous ad hoc data sources 
{\em incrementally}. The system takes as input an initial description 
and a new batch of data. It returns a
modified description that extends the initial description and covers the new 
data. The initial description may be supplied by the user or automatically
generated using the original \learnpads{} system. This iterative architecture
enables the learning of a very large data source by breaking it up 
into many smaller batches and updating the description from one batch to next.
