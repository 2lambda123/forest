Ad hoc data are semi-structured and non-standard data sources whose
formats are evolving and short of documentation.
As a consequence, off-the-shelf tools for processing such data often
do not exist, forcing analysts to develop their own tools, which is
costly and time-consuming.
In this paper, we present an incremental algorithm that automatically
infers the format of large scale data sources. From the resulting format
descriptions, we can generate a suite of data processing tools
automatically. The system can handle large-scale or streaming 
data sources whose formats evolve over time.  
Furthermore, it allows analysts to modify inferred
descriptions as desired and incorporates those changes in future revisions.
