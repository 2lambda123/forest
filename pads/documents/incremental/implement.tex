\section{Implementation and Evaluation}
\label{sec:imp}

 - parse metric
 - initial learn size and chunk size - these can affect results
 - update chunk by chunk 
 - optimizations/heuristics
   - memoization
   - the clean function (to reduce the number of parses)
   - merge adjacent const strings (only punctuation and white spaces)
   - control of aggregate size
   - deterministic unions
   - longest match in arrays
   - error recovery
   - parses cut-off: kill a parse if it has more than n consecutive failures in a struct

 - Experiments:
	1) comparison with old LearnPADS on several large datasets (ai.3000, asl.log, etc)
	   compare exec time and type complexity
	2) use ai format, do a table with 1000 5000 10000,...,1M miles
	   using orig learning system and the new system with various optimization turned on and off.
