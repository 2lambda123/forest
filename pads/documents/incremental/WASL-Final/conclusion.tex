\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
We have presented an incremental algorithm for inferring system log
formats.  We experimentally verified that this algorithm can produce
quality descriptions within minutes when run on files with hundreds of
thousands of lines.  Our experience suggests that the quality of
the final description is very sensitive to the quality of the initial
description.  Hence, we intend to work in the future on improving the
original algorithm to produce  better initial descriptions. 



%This is an idea inspired by the {\em generalized committed 
%choice} \cite{JaffarYZ07:gcc}. 
 

%  - efficiency in parsing
%  - concurrent parsing (GCC)
%  - quality of initial description
