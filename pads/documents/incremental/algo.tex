\section{The Algorithm}
\label{sec:algo}

 - problem definition (as close to the previous description as possible) (but we don't
   have a metric to measure how close yet, do we want to mention tree edit distance??)
 - overview of algorithm: parsing + aggregating + rewriting
 - parsing algo (parse rep, score metric, pseudo-code)
 - aggregating algo (in pseudo code)
 - selection of top aggregates
 - update original description
 - rewriting rules (data independent, data dependent, OptsTable)
