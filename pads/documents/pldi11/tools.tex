\section{Tools}
\label{sec:tools}
Third-party developers can use type-directed programming techniques~\cite{??} to
generate tools that will work for any file system structure that has a
\forest{} description.  As a proof of concept, we have written a
number of such tools, which we describe in this section.  We simulated
being third-party users by not changing the code of the \forest{}
compiler to build any of these tools.

\subsection{\fg{}}
\fg{} generates a graphical representation of any directory structure that matches a 
\forest{} specification.  We generated the graphs in
Figures~\ref{fig:student-pic} and \ref{fig:coral-pic} using  
this tool.  In the default configuration, \fg{} uses boxes to denote
directories and ovals to denote files with borders of varying
thickness to distinguish between ASCII and binary files.  
It draws the borders of symbolic links as dashed lines and components
with errors in red.

The core functionality of \fg{} lies in a Haskell function
called \texttt{mdToPDF}:

\begin{code}
mdToPDF :: ForestMD md => 
     md -> FilePath -> IO (Either String FilePath)
\end{code}
This type indicates the function takes as input any \forest{}
meta-data value and a filepath (that names the location for the
generated PDF file) and returns 

In this type, type variable \texttt{md} denotes any type belonging to
the \texttt{ForestMD} type class, which means that the type
\texttt{md} is a generated \forest{} meta-data type. 

This function takes as input any value belonging to the
\texttt{ForestMD} type class, (\ie, any value of type \texttt{md}
where \texttt{md} belongs 
which intuitively means \texttt{}
