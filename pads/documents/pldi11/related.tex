Microsoft LINQ: Language-integrated query.  Similar high-level goal:
support smooth, language-integrated data management.  Different 
implementation and language design.

vs PADS:  
\begin{itemize}
\item our data structures are larger --> lazy parsing
\item our nice design hides differences between structure inside /
outside of files
\item our semantics based on classical tree logic matching trees vs. 
recursive descent parser matching sequences.
\end{itemize}
