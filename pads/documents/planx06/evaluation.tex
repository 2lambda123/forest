\subsection{Materialization and Loading}

Hypothesis: bulk loading should not scale for increasing document size
(limits of main memory).  Show that smart/linear does scale.

\subsection{Querying}

Give examples of queries that analyst cares about. 

Example of query that can be evaluated in single scan over data
source, but is currently not 

Database person would balk at this point!  Why aren't you just loading
this data into a real database, building indices and getting good
query performance?  B/c data is ephmeral, queries are ephmeral, but
analyst/programmer should profit from disciplined access/querying of
their data.  Don't abandon them to Perl.
