\subsection{Materialization and Loading}

Lasagna performance issues (i.e. big picture, not just the one layer):

\begin{itemize}
\item Each level in the data model adds a small constant cost to
  touching the data.
\item The linear reading is indeed linear.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Querying}

Something about query evaluation:
Although we have not explored custom evaluation plans 
Galax's algebra or optimizer are particularly interesting in the 
\padx{}, we expect to do so 

Give examples of queries that analyst cares about. 

Example of query that can be evaluated in single scan over data
source, but is currently not 

Database person would balk at this point!  Why aren't you just loading
this data into a real database, building indices and getting good
query performance?  B/c data is ephmeral, queries are ephmeral, but
analyst/programmer should profit from disciplined access/querying of
their data.  Don't abandon them to Perl.
