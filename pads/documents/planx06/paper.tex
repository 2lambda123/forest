\cut{Enormous amounts of data exist in ``well-behaved'' formats
such as XML and relational databases, which come equipped with
extensive tool support.  However,  vast amounts of data also exist
in non-standard or \textit{ad hoc} data formats, which lack standard
tools. This deficiency forces data analysts to implement their own tools for
parsing, querying, and analyzing their ad hoc data.  The 
resulting tools typically interleave parsing, querying, and analysis,
obscuring the semantics of the data format and making it nearly
impossible for others to resuse the tools.}

This paper describes our experience designing and implementing
\padx{}, a system for querying large-scale ad hoc data sources with
XQuery.  \padx{} is the synthesis and extension of two existing
systems: \pads{} and \Galax{}. With \padx{}, an analyst writes a
declarative data description of the physical layout of her ad hoc
data, and the \pads{} compiler produces customizable libraries for
parsing the data and for viewing it as XML.  The resulting library is
linked with an XQuery engine, permitting the analyst to view and query
her ad hoc data sources using XQuery.

Compiled-query architectures~\cite{daytona}.  \padx{} has customized
data model: between points on continuum from fully interpreted query
plan applied to generic data model to fully compiled query plan
applied to customized data model.

Streamable query plans. 
BEA~\cite{DBLP:journals/vldb/FlorescuHKLRWCS04}
Phantom XML~\cite{rose:villard:2005}
Big open problem: Given arbitrary XQuery expression, determine whether
it can be evaluated in single scan over data.  Point out that this
problem is of interest for a different reason: fully pipeline
evaluation of queries over XML token streams.

We are currently working on improving \Galax{}'s ability to detect
streamable queries, to produce query plans that indeed use constant
memory space, and to 

ODO LIST: Better use of XML Schema simple types.
We don't take complete advantage of XML Schema, e.g., Penum types
could be modeled by XML Schema enumeration simple types, but currently
unsupported.

Open problem: give result of XQuery and its corresponding type,
serialize result back into PADS rep.  How are the syntactic
constraints for the new values expressed?  Tool could pick default
delimiters automatically. 

Open problem: given an arbitrary PADS type, permit skipping and
reading at arbitrary positions within the data source. 

These results are very preliminary, but we expect that further
work on producing one-scan query plans and on reducing the overhead in
the \padx{} data model 

indicate that
\padx{} can provide analysts 
Database person would balk at this point!  Why aren't you just loading
this data into a real database, building indices and getting good
query performance?  B/c data is ephmeral, queries are ephmeral, but
analyst/programmer should profit from disciplined access/querying of
their data.  Don't abandon them to Perl.
