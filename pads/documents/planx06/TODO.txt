Some of what we learned by writing this paper: 

1. Idealized version of PADX 

   o Prolog not generated or linked automatically 

   o Queries not statically typed

2. Additional features 

   o XML Schema (subset + annotations) for describing PADS types

   o XQuery constructors implemented in PADS

3. Code review of memory management modules

   o Expansion of RBufs is *VERY* slow.  

   o Hints to RBuf allocation functions are critical to performance.
     We need to understand this better.

4. Experiments
   
   o More complete experiments on sources with:
       different ambient codings, 
       recursive types, 
       more than one kind of record,
       structure other than the header,record array,trailer idiom 

5. Engineering

   o Have ONE template for PADX programs and parameterize it in a sane
     way to create a bulk/linear/smart executable. 

   o Review expulsion policy for smart nodes/records.
