What we learned by writing this paper: 

1. Idealized version of PADX 

   a. Prolog not generated or linked automatically 
   b. Queries not statically typed

2. Additional features 

   a. XML Schema (subset + annotations) for describing PADS types
   b. XQuery constructors implemented in PADS

3. Code review of memory management modules

   Expansion of RBufs is very slow.  

   Hints to RBuf allocation functions are critical to performance.  We
   need to understand this better.
