6/26:
allow to turn off smart_node meta-data caching.
use walk_chilren in pglx.c. Turn off printing. Just want to time
walking.
create new template to time walking.


PADS/X Story
----------------
Semantics : XQuery over non-XML (ad hoc, semi-structured, , large) data sources.
Streaming: access records in sequential/linear order
                     evaluate queries over seq. stream
Error-awareness: conditionally ignore unimportant data
  [Convery Semantics of Query => PADS read fns]


Performance Numbers:

1. Galax Query Plan
2. Galax Datamodel
3. PADX Node Reads Bulk/Smart/Linear
4. PADS Record Reads: Mask[on/off] [No Masks.]
	(consequence of error-aware computing).

Examples:
Newick?
Phone numbers : call_detail.p ?
DNS : dns.p
Dibbler Data : dibbler.p
Web Server (cheap mask) ai.p
 (note: masks set choose to set in-mem rep; check constraints)

Timing:
run 7 times. drop hi and low. take mean, median std. dev.
