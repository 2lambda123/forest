PADS/X Story
----------------
Semantics : XQuery over non-XML (ad hoc, semi-structured, , large) data sources.
Streaming: access records in sequential/linear order
                     evaluate queries over seq. stream
Error-awareness: conditionally ignore unimportant data
  [Convery Semantics of Query => PADS read fns]


Performance Numbers:

1. Galax Query Plan
2. Galax Datamodel
3. PADX Node Reads Bulk/Smart/Linear
4. PADS Record Reads Mask[on/off] No Masks.]
	(consequence of error-aware computing).

Examples:
Newick
Phone numbers
DNS
Dibbler Data
Web Server (cheap mask)
 (note: masks set choose to set in-mem rep; check constraints)

Timing:
run 7 times. drop hi and low. take mean, median std. dev.
