\section{Using \pads{} to Access Ad Hoc Data [Kathleen]}
\label{section:pads}

Focus on expressiveness of data description language.

Generated library : rep, pd, and per-type parsing functions and other
type specific tools (but we're talking about those here). 

Error-aware data processing.  

Many of PADS features are not described here b/c they are not germane
to understand this work.  See PLDI and POPL papers.
