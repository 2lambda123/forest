\begin{abstract}  

  Massive amounts of useful data are stored and processed in
  {\textit ad hoc formats}, which are data formats for which critical tools
  like parsers, analysis tools,and pretty printers do not
  exist. Traditional databases and XML systems provide rich
  infrastructure for processing well-behaved data, but are of little
  use when dealing with data in ad hoc formats.
  To address the challenges of such data, we have designed PADS/ML,
  a declarative data description language for the ML family of
  languages. PADS/ML is based on the ML type structure and features
  polymorphic, recursive datatypes as the central means for describing
  data. In addition, PADS/ML exploits the ML module system to
  provide a tool generation architecture that simplifies the task of
  developing tools customized to manage data conforming to any
  PADS/ML description. 
  We have formalized the semantics of PADS/ML's datatypes by extending
  our previous work on the Data Description Calculus with
  type-paramterized types, and we have proven the resulting system
  ``type-correct.'' That is, generated parsers return data of the
  expected type.
  Finally, we have implemented a version of PADS/ML for the O'Caml
  language.  From a description, the O'Caml PADS/ML compiler generates
  an O'Caml module containing the relevant type declarations, a parser
  for the description, and other tools.
