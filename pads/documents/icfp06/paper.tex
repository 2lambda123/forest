\begin{abstract}  

  Massive amounts of useful data are stored and processed in
  non-standard or ad hoc formats, for which critical tools like
  parsers and formatters do not exist. Traditional databases and XML
  systems provide rich infrastructure for processing well-behaved
  data, but are of little help when dealing with data in ad hoc
  formats.
 
  To address the challenges of ad hoc data, we have designed PADS/ML -
  a declarative data description language for the ML family of
  languages. PADS/ML is based on the ML type structure and features
  polymorphic, recursive datatypes as central elements of data
  descriptions. In addition, PADS/ML exploits the ML module system to
  support an entirely new tool generation architecture designed to
  simplify the task of developing tool generators that work for any
  PADS/ML description.

  We have formalized the semantics of PADS/ML's recursive, polymorphic
  datatypes by extending our previous work on the Data Description
  Calculus with type-paramterized types and we have proven the
  resulting system ``type-correct.'' That is, generated parsers return
  data of the expected type.

  Finally, we have implemented a version of PADS/ML for the O'Caml
  language.  From a description, the O'Caml PADS/ML compiler generates
  an O'Caml module containing the relevant type declarations, a parser
  for the description, and other tools.
