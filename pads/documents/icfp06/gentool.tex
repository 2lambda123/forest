\section{A Generic Tool Framework}
\label{sec:gen-tool}

\begin{itemize}
\item Intro
\item Implementation: modules and functors.
\item Explanation of traversal functor functionality (conceptual level).
\item Overview of generic tool interface.
\item Explanation of selected portions of gen. tool interface.
\item Discuss two example tools: formatter, accumulator.
\item Show output examples from tools.
\end{itemize}

Intro outline:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tools are essential benefit of PADS.
\item Tool generator development is difficult. How can we separate
  from compiler? Want to give developer clean interface for writing
  generic tools.
\item Many tools share same characteristic: traversal and processing.
\item Traversal is description specific while processing is tool specific.
\item Split into generic tool and generic traversal.
\end{itemize}
