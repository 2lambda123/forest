\section{From \padsmlbig{} to \ocaml{}}
\label{sec:padsml-impl}

\begin{itemize}
\item Compiler generates module for each description.
\item Example: Transforming data with \padsml{} and \ocaml{}.
\item Example: querying data.
\item Example: processing data (take average).
\end{itemize}


\section{A Generic Tool Framework}
\label{sec:gen-tool}

\begin{itemize}
\item Tools are essential benefit of PADS.
\item Tool generator development is difficult. How can we separate
  from compiler? Want to give developer clean interface for writing
  generic tools.
\item Many tools share same characteristic: traversal and processing.
\item Traversal is description specific while processing is tool specific.
\item Split into generic tool and generic traversal.
\item Implementation with modules and functors.
\item Example tools, w/ programs using tools and their outputs.
