\section{Sample Forest Descriptions}
\ifanon
This appendix contains auxiliary materials provided for the PLDI 2011
review process. Specifically, it contains \forest{} descriptions of a
variety of different \filestores{}.

This appendix contains contains \forest{} descriptions of a

The material in this appendix is best viewed electronically.  Some of
the generated graphs are very large, but have been shrunk to fit on a
single page.  They will not display well when printed.  However,
readers may zoom in electronically on the PDF to view the details.


\subsection{Pads Web Site Description}
This \forest{} description describes the \pads{} web site. The
description starts with \pads{} descriptions of files that contain
information that impacts the directory structure. The
configuration file supplies the paths where various components of the
website should be located.  The \cd{SourceNames} file lists the names
of the data files available for the demo.  Each user directory will
have a subdirectory for each file listed in \cd{SourceNames}. Each
user is logged in the file \cd{UserEntries}.  For each user in this
file, there is a directory with a corresponding name containing all of
the information relevant to that user.  A graph
of the \pads{} website, generated using the \cd{ForestGraph} tool
follows the description.

\section{Students.hs Description}
This section includes the \forest{} description of the Princeton
Computer Science Department \filestore{}.
\input{Students}

\section{Coral.hs Description}

This section gives the PADS and Forest descriptions for the CoralCDN
Log repository. A graph of the CoralCDN
repository, generated like the graph above using the \cd{ForestGraph}
tool from the description and (a subset of) the actual repository 
follows.

\input{Coral}

\section{Gene Ontology}

This section presents a description of gene ontology data found 
here: \url{http://www.geneontology.org/gene-associations/}.
A graph generated using \texttt{ForestGraph}
on a subset of the data follows the description.

This \filestore{} is a web directory of gene association data files.
The root directory contains a number of \cd{.gz} files,
a \cd{readme} directory and a \cd{submission} directory.
Each \cd{.gz} file is the gene ontology (GO) data of the genes
in one or more organism, and the file names have the format
\cd{"gene_association.XXX_YYY.gz"}, where \cd{XXX} represents the
name of the institute that provides the data and \cd{YYY} is the
name of the organism. \cd{YYY} is optional because some institute
provides the data for only one organism.

The \cd{readme} directory contains a set of \cd{.README} files for a
subset of the GO data in the root.

The \cd{submission} directory contains a set of \cd{.gz} files, their
corresponding \cd{.conf} files, and a \cd{paint} sub-directory.
The \cd{.gz} files are similar to the ones
in root except they are older. The \cd{.conf} file summarizes
some attributes of the \cd{.gz} file such as ``the name of the project'',
``contact email'', \etc{} The paint sub-directory contains
a further set of subdirectories of the form \cd{PTHRXXXXX}, where
\cd{XXXXX} is a 5-digit number. These subdirectories each contain
six text files and an XML file. These are the annotation inference
of the gene ontology using phylogenetic trees and the PAINT tool.

\section{CVS.hs Description}

This section provides a generic description for CVS repositories.

\input{CVS}

\section{Universal.hs Description}

This section includes a universal data description.  This universal description
is used to drive some of our generic tools.
