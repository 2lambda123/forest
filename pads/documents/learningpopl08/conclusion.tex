Managing ad hoc data is a tedious, error-prone and costly enterprise.
By augmenting the \pads{} data processing language and system with an
efficient format inference engine, we have effectively cut the
generation time for useful data analysis and transformation tools from
hours or days to seconds.  Now, within moments of receiving a new ad
hoc data source, programmers can write complex semi-structured queries
to extract information, produce informative graphs of key statistics,
convert the data into a format amenable to easy loading into
Excel or translate to \xml{} for processing with other
standard programming libraries and systems.  Systems administrators,
computational scientists, financial analysts, industrial data
management teams and everyday programmers will all benefit
substantially from this new capability to translate dirt in useful
shovels for ad hoc data processing.
