\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
Many applications rely on the file system to store persistent data,
but current programming languages lack convenient constructs for
manipulating file system data. Previous work on the Forest language
developed a type-based abstraction for file systems in which the
programmer writes a high-level specification describing the expected
structure of the file system, and the compiler generates an in-memory
representation for the data and accompanying ``load'' and ``store''
functions. Unfortunately Forest does not provide any consistency
guarantees so if multiple applications are manipulating the file
system concurrently---by far the common case---it can produce
incorrect results.

This paper presents Transactional Forest: an extension to Forest that
enriches the language with seralizable transactions. We present the
design of the language, which is based on a new ``atomic'' construct
and a monad that tracks effects. We formalize the semantics of POSIX
file systems in a simple core calculus and prove the correctness of
our implementation. We discuss our implementation in Haskell and
illustrate its use on a substantial case study: the Soil and Water
Assessment Tool (SWAT), which is a modeling tool used by numerous
hydrologists and environmental scientists.
