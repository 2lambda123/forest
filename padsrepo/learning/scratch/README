This directory contains a prototype system for inferring a desription
of newline-separated ASCII data.  

Requirements:
You must have sml/nj 110.59 or later.

To build:
> make

To invoke:
./learn --help
Prototype Learning System
learn  [-d <string>] [-maxdepth <int>] [-lineNos] [-ids] [-h <float>] [-s <float>] [-n <float>] [-a <int>] [-j <float>] [--help] file...
-d	output directory (default gen/)
-maxdepth	maximum depth for exploration (default 50)
-lineNos	print line numbers in output contexts (default false)
-ids	print ids in type and tokens matching base types (default false)
-h	histogram comparison tolerance (percentage, default 0.01)
-s	struct determination tolerance (percentage, default 0.1)
-n	noise level (percentage, default 0.0)
-a	minimum array width (default 2)
-j	junk threshold (percentage, default 0.1)


Sample invocation:
./learn data/apache.txt -d output/apache -maxdepth 3 

The tool currently sends to standard out the following information:
* A count of the number of records in the input file
* A list of the frequency distributions of the tokens in the file,
  grouped into clusters, sorted by the cluster with the lowest
  "score".  The score is a heuristic designed to find the cluster with
  the strongest signal.  
* An output indicating which cluster the system chose and the coverage
  of that cluster. 
* A representation of the inferred top-level type of the data in outputdir/Ty.
  Contexts that have not yet been analyzed are marked TBD.  For each
  such marker TBD_i in the type representation, there is a file in
  outputdir/TBD_i containing the portion of the original input that
  falls into that context.  Contexts that the system gave up on are
  marked BTM.  For each such marker BTM_i in the type representation,
  there is a file in outputdir/BTM_i containing the portion of the
  original input that falls into that context.
* The output directory also contains a file params that stores the
  settings of the various toggles in the output run.
