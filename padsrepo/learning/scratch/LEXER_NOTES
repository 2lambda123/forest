There is a bug in smlnj.110-65 and earlier that the output of ml-ulex
is tripping.  The workaround is to replace the generated eof function
in *.lex.sml files:

	fun eof (Stream {strm, ...}) = TSIO.endOfStream strm 

with

        fun eof s = not (isSome (getc s))

This bug will be fixed in smlnj.110-66, so this note can go away with
later version of the sml compiler.
