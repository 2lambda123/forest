ABSTRACT
 KSF: rewrite with focus on converting into standard representations

INTRO
 KSF: rewrite along the lines of wasl slides

PADS & LEARNPADS
 add citations to sigmod demo papers.

INCREMENTAL ALGORITHM
 explore different metric for unions (KSF)
 explore geometric mean rather than sum (KQZ?)
 explore MDL tutorial (DPW?)

IMPLEMENTATION
 describe in more detail (KQZ then DPW?)

EVALUATION of LEARNING
 - Test suite:
   common log format (apache)
   compound log format (pws, yellow pages)
   sueprcomputer logs
   include longer description of each format; 
       explore making (subsets) of formats available on-line.
   size of data in lines and bytes
   complexity of gold descriptions (TC, ADC, MDL score)
 - Quality of inferred descriptions
   number of parsing errors from inferred descriptions
   TC, ADC, MDL compared with gold description  
 - Time performance:
   parsing time:
     wc -l time
     parse with Pstring(:Peor:) as description of each record
     parse time gold descriptions
     parse time inferred descriptions
   learning time:
     explore initial batch size across test suite
     explore incremental batch size across test suite
     choosing best initial batch and best incremental sizes, explore
       scaling with all large files that we have available.
 
FROM PADS to XML
  XML because data tends to be semi-structured.
  Tool:
    describe translation from PADS -> Canonical XSD for data.
    Give example for running example of wsl

  Evaluation:
    complexity of XSD for gold standard; size of generated XML 
    complexity of XSD for inferred description; size of generated XML

RELATED WORK
 David do initial draft

FUTURE WORK
 Interactive UI to refine descriptions?
