Internet and telecommunications companies process large amount of data in a variety of formats, 
many of which are semi-structured and/or non-standard.
Because of the non-standard nature of these formats, off-the-shelf tools for processing such logs often
do not exist, forcing analysts to develop their own tools, which is costly and time-consuming.
In this paper, we present an incremental algorithm that automatically
infers the format description of ad hoc data, and translates it into XML, 
for which processing tools are abundant.  
The system can handle large-scale data sources whose formats
evolve over time.  Furthermore, it allows analysts to modify inferred
descriptions as desired and incorporates those changes in future revisions.
Our experiments showed that the system scales almost linearly with the size
of the data and is able to produce a correct description for a 
30 GB super computer event log in as little as 15 minutes.
