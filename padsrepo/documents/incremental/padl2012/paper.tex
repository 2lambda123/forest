\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
Ad hoc data files such as systems logs 
are extremely difficult to manage because of their large size,
evolving format, and lack of documentation.
In this paper, we have presented the design, implementation and
evaluation of a system for learning the structure of 
large industrial ad hoc data files.  The system not only
produces documentation for the files in the form of a \pads{}
description, but it can also be used to generate end-to-end
data processing tools such as a statistical analysis or an
XML translator.  We have shown that the system
can scale to the point where it can process and learn the
structure of logs on the order of up to 30GB or more in 
a few hours.
