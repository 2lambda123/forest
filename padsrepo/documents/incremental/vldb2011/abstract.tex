An ad hoc data source is any semi-structured, non-standard data sources.  
The format of such data sources is often evolving and frequently lacking documentation.
As a consequence, off-the-shelf tools for processing such data often
do not exist, forcing analysts to develop their own tools, a
costly and time-consuming process.
In this paper, we present an incremental algorithm that automatically
infers the format of large-scale data sources. From the resulting format
descriptions, we can generate a suite of data processing tools
automatically. The system can handle large-scale or streaming 
data sources whose formats evolve over time.  
Furthermore, it allows analysts to modify inferred
descriptions as desired and incorporates those changes in future revisions.
