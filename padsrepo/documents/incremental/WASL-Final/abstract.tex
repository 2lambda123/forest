System logs come in a large and evolving variety of formats, many of
which are semi-structured and/or non-standard.
As a consequence, off-the-shelf tools for processing such logs often
do not exist, forcing analysts to develop their own tools, which is
costly and time-consuming.
In this paper, we present an incremental algorithm that automatically
infers the format of system log files.  From the resulting format
descriptions, we can generate a suite of data processing tools
automatically. The system can handle large-scale data sources whose formats
evolve over time.  Furthermore, it allows analysts to modify inferred
descriptions as desired and incorporates those changes in future revisions.
