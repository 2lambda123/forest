We (Mary Fernandez, Bob Gruber, and Kathleen Fisher) would like to
host a summer student to continue integrating PADS and Galax.  Last
summer, Ricardo Medel helped us integrate the two systems to the point
where we can now write XQueries that run against data with a PADS
description without requiring that data to be translated into XML.  At
the moment, however, that data must fit into main memory, a poor
assumption for much of our data.

Our goal for this summer is to extend the Galax data API with
functions to support streaming access and to enrich the generated PADS
libraries to provide these additional functions.

Ideally, the summer student would be a programming languages graduate
student familiar with functional programming, particularly ML or
O'Caml, as those are the languages in which PADS and Galax are
implemented.
