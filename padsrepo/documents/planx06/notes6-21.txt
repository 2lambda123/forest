6/26:
x Generalize gendata.sh to take target file size.

- Allow to turn off smart_node meta-data caching.
  Do we need to cache even the data itself? Here's the algorithm:

  getKthChild node k =
     if data_terminated or k < next_elt_to_read then
        return 0

     do
        res = elt_read(&m,&pd&rep)
	if (res = PANIC) then return 0
        next_elt_to_read++
     while data_not_terminated and k >= next_elt_to_read

     if k = next_elt_to_read - 1 then
        return newNode(m,pd,rep)
 
     return 0     

     We could also consider buffering a few elements to increase
     locality. i.e. the same code invoked repeatedly in sequence,
     rather than once at a time, with totally different code (up the
     call stack) in between.
     

- In terms of testing, I think we need to distinguish between creating a
  new streaming-read feature and timing it. What exactly do we hope to
  accomplish with the timing?

x Use walk_chilren in pglx.c. Turn off printing. Just want to time
  walking.
  create new template to time walking.


PADS/X Story
------------
Semantics : XQuery over non-XML (ad hoc, semi-structured, , large) data sources.
Streaming: access records in sequential/linear order
                     evaluate queries over seq. stream
Error-awareness: conditionally ignore unimportant data
  [Convery Semantics of Query => PADS read fns]
