\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this section, we end with any remaining thoughts and comments.  We
can make comments about future work or other possible improvements.
We should end with a crisp paragraph summarizing the contribution of
the paper.  (The reviewers are likely to have to write a summary of
the paper; this paragraph is more or less what we want them to write
in their review).
