chris conf call friday at 1pm 
888 895 4286, code 569707
staffing:
 . kenny visa issue?
   itar export restrictions
   fairly high burden on galois not to violate itar
   would have to check with afrl contracting folks.
   depending on what we do with network forensics
   may be a problem: customers, data sources, analysis domains.
   can we find a us citizen?
   we should also check on David Walker's status
  
follow on proposal questions
 . difference between seedling final report & follow-on
   proposal?  Can they be the same document?  How close?
   basic study to see if there is any way to proceed fruitfully. phase 2 proposal: what you would do after phase 1, than the details of what is phase 1. phase 2 is a concrete plan of action, specific people, implementations.  how to implement it.  a number of ways that a given architecture might be realized.
   
schedule issues (agressive, but good)
 . march second meeting?
 . april submission?
 . may final meeting?

domain experts
 . discuss expert interview template, ask for feedback
 . ask about Gary Klein and Col. Hunt (haven't heard back, has now retired :-(, have sent mail from people who have replaced.  chris will ping them again), 
 . are there any others we should talk to?
 . mention book on real digital forensics

really understand relationship between technical innovation and something that customer really needs.

3 hrs meeting
late morning, 10am-2 going over lunch.
florham park
order lunch in, chris can pitch in.
slides a day before.

timeline
 - end of january: interviews done
 - february: 
    slides on architecture
    latex doc w/prelim nfw architecture
 - march: send out for feedback from domain experts
 - april: inc results into final proposal

***********************************************
related work:
 grammar learning in machine learning 
 negative results for simple dfas, cfas, better w/probabilities

   Boos allen
   phone conference with forensic analysis
   they are interested, sent nda
   portland state: fang brothers?
- Underlying theory
  phd thesis on learning context free grammars for info extraction, 2003

Draft Agenda for conference call, 11/20/2006
--------------------------------------------
Congratulations to everyone on finally getting the contract!
Thanks to Stacey.
Date of kick-off meeting settled, Dec. 8, midday meeting
Go over Chris' template (summary below)
Go over what we have to do (draft summary below)
 - figure out lead for each area
 - schedule
 - resources
Other issues?
  
follow up
  - getting david up and running with pads system
  - technical discussion

Chris's template
 . technical summary chart (david walker)
 . complete "org chart" + time on project. (david burke)
 . project schedule (david walker)
    Gantt chart
    (email says we don't have to do earned value analysis)
    major tasks broken into subtasks
      - tasks: target completion date, status, resources allocated
      - management cost as task
      - binary status: complete or not 
 . financial expenditures report, related to gantt chart (david walker)
 . recent accomplishments (signed contract; david burke)
    - completed tasks
    - status of not completed tasks
    - schedule deviations
 . current plan (kathleen)
    - what will be done before "next" meeting.
 . test & evaluation plan (david burke)
 . risk assessment (technical, management, market) (david walker)
    - previously known risks
    - newly identified risk
       subject matter experts not useful
       format inference not work
         - user interface design
         - focused intervention
        project too small for management risks
        market risk: is not operative
 . Intellectual property developments (kathleen)
     - seedling proposal does not depend on pads infrastructure
     - in negotiations with AT&T for follow
 . Wrap up of admin stuff (david burke)
<break>

 . Technical discussion (expand as necessary)
      overview slide (kfisher)
      background on ad hoc data & pads (kfisher)

         - tokenization (kfisher)
         - structure discovery (kfisher)
         - refinement (david walker)
      underlying theory (kfisher)
      metrics complexity (david burke)
        * score: how good, how complex

        - aike
      experimental evaluation (david walker)
      binary format
 . Wrap up of technical stuff
