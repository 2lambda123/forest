\subsection{Graphs and their shifts}

\begdef
\textit{adjacency matrix} of G, $A = A(G)$ or $A = A_G$.

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph.
Let $I,J \in V$.
Let $A_{IJ} = \mathrm{card}\{e\ .\ i(e) = I \wedge t(e) = J\}$.
Then $A = [A_{IJ}]$ is the \textit{adjacency matrix} of G, written
$A = A(G)$ or $A = A_G$.
\edefi

\begdef
\textit{graph} of $A$, $G = G(A) = G_A$

Let $A = [A_{IJ}]$ be an $r \times r$ matrix with nonnegative integer entries.
The \textit{graph} of $A$, written $G = G(A) = G_A$ is the graph $G=(V,E)$ where
$V = \{1, \ldots, r\}$,
and $E$ has $A_{IJ}$ distinct edges having $i(e) = I$ and $t(e) = J$.
\edefi

\begthm
Adjacency matrix and graph functions are inverses.

\begin{eqnarray}
A=A(G(A))           \\
G \cong G(A(G))
\end{eqnarray}

\end{theorem}

\begdef
\textit{edge shift} $\mathbb{X}_G$ of graph $G$

Let $G$ be a graph. The shift space of $G$ is
$\mathbb{X}_G = \{\xi=(\xi_i)_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\ .\ t(\xi_i) = i(\xi_{i+1})\}$.
\edefi

\begrem
If $G$ has adjacendy matrix $A$, then $\mathbb{X}_G$ can
also be written $\mathbb{X}_A$,
the \textit{edge shift} of the matrix $A$.
\end{remark}

\begdef
Path of length $m$ in $G$.

A path of length $m$ in $G$ is a map $\func{\fromzero{m}}{\pi}{E(G)}$ such
that $t(\pi(i)) = i(\pi(e_{i+1}))$, i.e. such that the terminal node
of one edge is the initial node of the next edge. We can write
$\pi = e_0 e_1 \ldots e_{m-1}$, in which case the condition is
that $t(e_i) = i(e_{i+1})$.
\edefi

\begthm
Path counts in powers of an adjacency matrix.

Let $G$ be a graph with adjacency matrix $A$.
Then $A_IJ^m$ is the number of paths from I to J.
\end{theorem}

\begthm
Cycle counts in powers of an adjencency matrix.

Let $G$ be a graph with adjacency matrix $A$.
Then $tr(A^m)$ is the number cycles in $G$ of length $m$.
This is also the number of points in $\mathbf{X}_G$ with period $m$.
\end{theorem}

\begdef
\textit{irreducible} (or \textit{strongly connected}) graph $G$.

$G$ is irreducible if for every vertices $I$ and $J$ there is a path
from $I$ to $J$.
