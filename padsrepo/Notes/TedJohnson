Meeting with Ted Johnson on 12/4/02 Gigascope

   1. Netflow data
          * variable-width pieces
          * earlier fields indicate how to parse later fields
          * lots of overlays
          * extremely high performance
    * headers that contain information that should be associated with every packet.

2 BGP data might be a good place to start.

Accumulators

   1. Finding keys (number of unique values = number of records)
   2. Finding correlations between fields (to find good join candidates)
    * hash function minimum sampling technique
   3. Can help with getting db set up on pc if desired.
   4. Characterize tail of distributions using ??? 

Conclusions: support fields with values set from calculated values. (currently through dummy) support switched unions (design and implement) check nested cascading values. ask for gigascope protocol description of netflow/bgp data and sample get functions write switched version of netflow description

let user set in discipline the size of the hash table
